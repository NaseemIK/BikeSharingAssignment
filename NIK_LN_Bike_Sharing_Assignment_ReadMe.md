## **Overview**

###### **Background:**  
- BoomBikes is a popular bike-sharing service that has experienced a significant decline in demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As cities begin to recover and restrictions ease, predicting future bike demand is crucial for the companyâ€™s recovery and growth.  
- This project aims to model and understand the factors influencing bike demand using historical data to help BoomBikes adjust their strategies for resource allocation, pricing, and operational planning.

###### **Business Challenge:**  
- The key challenge is predicting bike-sharing demand by identifying critical variables such as weather, seasonality, holidays, and day of the week, enabling BoomBikes to make data-driven decisions for optimal service delivery.

###### **Dataset:**  
- The dataset (day.CSV) used in this analysis includes bike-sharing data from the post-COVID period, including information on weather, holidays, seasonality, and demand levels (e.g., casual and registered users, temperature, humidity, etc.).

## **Key Findings**

- **Seasonal Demand:** **Spring** consistently shows the highest demand for bike-sharing services, suggesting a need for special marketing efforts during this period.
- **Month-wise Insights:** **September** has significant demand due to favorable weather conditions, requiring targeted promotions to capitalize on this period.
- **Post-COVID Trends:** Historical data indicates an expected demand increase as the pandemic normalizes, emphasizing the importance of preparing for a surge in customers.
- **Weather Impact:** **Light Snow** and **Rainy** conditions generally result in fewer rentals, indicating the need for strategies during adverse weather to maintain operations.

## **Strategic Recommendations**

- **Promotional Offers:** Launch campaigns in **Spring** to capture demand during favorable weather.
- **Targeted Advertising:** Focus on **September** with advertisements tailored to peak demand.
- **Weather Adaptation:** Plan for off-peak periods (like snow or rain) to focus on **bike maintenance** and infrastructure improvements while minimizing service disruptions.

## **Technologies Utilized**

- **Python 3.x**
- **Pandas**
- **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib**
- **Seaborn**
