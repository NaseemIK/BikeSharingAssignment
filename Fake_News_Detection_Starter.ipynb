       "      <td>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The head of a conservative Republican faction in the U.S. Congress, who voted this month for a huge expansion of the national debt to pay for tax cuts, called himself a “fiscal conservative” on Sunday and urged budget restraint in 2018. In keeping with a sharp pivot under way among Republicans, U.S. Representative Mark Meadows, speaking on CBS’ “Face the Nation,” drew a hard line on federal spending, which lawmakers are bracing to do battle over in January. When they return from the holidays on Wednesday, lawmakers will begin trying to pass a federal budget in a fight likely to be linked to other issues, such as immigration policy, even as the November congressional election campaigns approach in which Republicans will seek to keep control of Congress. President Donald Trump and his Republicans want a big budget increase in military spending, while Democrats also want proportional increases for non-defense “discretionary” spending on programs that support education, scientific research, infrastructure, public health and environmental protection. “The (Trump) administration has already been willing to say: ‘We’re going to increase non-defense discretionary spending ... by about 7 percent,’” Meadows, chairman of the small but influential House Freedom Caucus, said on the program. “Now, Democrats are saying that’s not enough, we need to give the government a pay raise of 10 to 11 percent. For a fiscal conservative, I don’t see where the rationale is. ... Eventually you run out of other people’s money,” he said. Meadows was among Republicans who voted in late December for their party’s debt-financed tax overhaul, which is expected to balloon the federal budget deficit and add about $1.5 trillion over 10 years to the $20 trillion national debt. “It’s interesting to hear Mark talk about fiscal responsibility,” Democratic U.S. Representative Joseph Crowley said on CBS. Crowley said the Republican tax bill would require the  United States to borrow $1.5 trillion, to be paid off by future generations, to finance tax cuts for corporations and the rich. “This is one of the least ... fiscally responsible bills we’ve ever seen passed in the history of the House of Representatives. I think we’re going to be paying for this for many, many years to come,” Crowley said. Republicans insist the tax package, the biggest U.S. tax overhaul in more than 30 years,  will boost the economy and job growth. House Speaker Paul Ryan, who also supported the tax bill, recently went further than Meadows, making clear in a radio interview that welfare or “entitlement reform,” as the party often calls it, would be a top Republican priority in 2018. In Republican parlance, “entitlement” programs mean food stamps, housing assistance, Medicare and Medicaid health insurance for the elderly, poor and disabled, as well as other programs created by Washington to assist the needy. Democrats seized on Ryan’s early December remarks, saying they showed Republicans would try to pay for their tax overhaul by seeking spending cuts for social programs. But the goals of House Republicans may have to take a back seat to the Senate, where the votes of some Democrats will be needed to approve a budget and prevent a government shutdown. Democrats will use their leverage in the Senate, which Republicans narrowly control, to defend both discretionary non-defense programs and social spending, while tackling the issue of the “Dreamers,” people brought illegally to the country as children. Trump in September put a March 2018 expiration date on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program, which protects the young immigrants from deportation and provides them with work permits. The president has said in recent Twitter messages he wants funding for his proposed Mexican border wall and other immigration law changes in exchange for agreeing to help the Dreamers. Representative Debbie Dingell told CBS she did not favor linking that issue to other policy objectives, such as wall funding. “We need to do DACA clean,” she said.  On Wednesday, Trump aides will meet with congressional leaders to discuss those issues. That will be followed by a weekend of strategy sessions for Trump and Republican leaders on Jan. 6 and 7, the White House said. Trump was also scheduled to meet on Sunday with Florida Republican Governor Rick Scott, who wants more emergency aid. The House has passed an $81 billion aid package after hurricanes in Florida, Texas and Puerto Rico, and wildfires in California. The package far exceeded the $44 billion requested by the Trump administration. The Senate has not yet voted on the aid.</td>\n",

       "      <td>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Transgender people will be allowed for the first time to enlist in the U.S. military starting on Monday as ordered by federal courts, the Pentagon said on Friday, after President Donald Trump’s administration decided not to appeal rulings that blocked his transgender ban. Two federal appeals courts, one in Washington and one in Virginia, last week rejected the administration’s request to put on hold orders by lower court judges requiring the military to begin accepting transgender recruits on Jan. 1. A Justice Department official said the administration will not challenge those rulings. “The Department of Defense has announced that it will be releasing an independent study of these issues in the coming weeks. So rather than litigate this interim appeal before that occurs, the administration has decided to wait for DOD’s study and will continue to defend the president’s lawful authority in District Court in the meantime,” the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. In September, the Pentagon said it had created a panel of senior officials to study how to implement a directive by Trump to prohibit transgender individuals from serving. The Defense Department has until Feb. 21 to submit a plan to Trump. Lawyers representing currently-serving transgender service members and aspiring recruits said they had expected the administration to appeal the rulings to the conservative-majority Supreme Court, but were hoping that would not happen. Pentagon spokeswoman Heather Babb said in a statement: “As mandated by court order, the Department of Defense is prepared to begin accessing transgender applicants for military service Jan. 1. All applicants must meet all accession standards.” Jennifer Levi, a lawyer with gay, lesbian and transgender advocacy group GLAD, called the decision not to appeal “great news.” “I’m hoping it means the government has come to see that there is no way to justify a ban and that it’s not good for the military or our country,” Levi said. Both GLAD and the American Civil Liberties Union represent plaintiffs in the lawsuits filed against the administration. In a move that appealed to his hard-line conservative supporters, Trump announced in July that he would prohibit transgender people from serving in the military, reversing Democratic President Barack Obama’s policy of accepting them. Trump said on Twitter at the time that the military “cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail.” Four federal judges - in Baltimore, Washington, D.C., Seattle and Riverside, California - have issued rulings blocking Trump’s ban while legal challenges to the Republican president’s policy proceed. The judges said the ban would likely violate the right under the U.S. Constitution to equal protection under the law. The Pentagon on Dec. 8 issued guidelines to recruitment personnel in order to enlist transgender applicants by Jan. 1. The memo outlined medical requirements and specified how the applicants’ sex would be identified and even which undergarments they would wear. The Trump administration previously said in legal papers that the armed forces were not prepared to train thousands of personnel on the medical standards needed to process transgender applicants and might have to accept “some individuals who are not medically fit for service.” The Obama administration had set a deadline of July 1, 2017, to begin accepting transgender recruits. But Trump’s defense secretary, James Mattis, postponed that date to Jan. 1, 2018, which the president’s ban then put off indefinitely. Trump has taken other steps aimed at rolling back transgender rights. In October, his administration said a federal law banning gender-based workplace discrimination does not protect transgender employees, reversing another Obama-era position. In February, Trump rescinded guidance issued by the Obama administration saying that public schools should allow transgender students to use the restroom that corresponds to their gender identity.</td>\n",

       "      <td>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The special counsel investigation of links between Russia and President Trump’s 2016 election campaign should continue without interference in 2018, despite calls from some Trump administration allies and Republican lawmakers to shut it down, a prominent Republican senator said on Sunday. Lindsey Graham, who serves on the Senate armed forces and judiciary committees, said Department of Justice Special Counsel Robert Mueller needs to carry on with his Russia investigation without political interference. “This investigation will go forward. It will be an investigation conducted without political influence,” Graham said on CBS’s Face the Nation news program. “And we all need to let Mr. Mueller do his job. I think he’s the right guy at the right time.”  The question of how Russia may have interfered in the election, and how Trump’s campaign may have had links with or co-ordinated any such effort, has loomed over the White House since Trump took office in January. It shows no sign of receding as Trump prepares for his second year in power, despite intensified rhetoric from some Trump allies in recent weeks accusing Mueller’s team of bias against the Republican president. Trump himself seemed to undercut his supporters in an interview last week with the New York Times in which he said he expected Mueller was “going to be fair.”    Russia’s role in the election and the question of possible links to the Trump campaign are the focus of multiple inquiries in Washington. Three committees of the Senate and the House of Representatives are investigating, as well as Mueller, whose team in May took over an earlier probe launched by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). Several members of the Trump campaign and administration have been convicted or indicted in the investigation.  Trump and his allies deny any collusion with Russia during the campaign, and the Kremlin has denied meddling in the election. Graham said he still wants an examination of the FBI’s use of a dossier on links between Trump and Russia that was compiled by a former British spy, Christopher Steele, which prompted Trump allies and some Republicans to question Mueller’s inquiry.   On Saturday, the New York Times reported that it was not that dossier that triggered an early FBI probe, but a tip from former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos to an Australian diplomat that Russia had damaging information about former Trump rival Hillary Clinton.  “I want somebody to look at the way the Department of Justice used this dossier. It bothers me greatly the way they used it, and I want somebody to look at it,” Graham said. But he said the Russia investigation must continue. “As a matter of fact, it would hurt us if we ignored it,” he said.</td>\n",

       "      <td>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos told an Australian diplomat in May 2016 that Russia had political dirt on Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, the New York Times reported on Saturday. The conversation between Papadopoulos and the diplomat, Alexander Downer, in London was a driving factor behind the FBI’s decision to open a counter-intelligence investigation of Moscow’s contacts with the Trump campaign, the Times reported. Two months after the meeting, Australian officials passed the information that came from Papadopoulos to their American counterparts when leaked Democratic emails began appearing online, according to the newspaper, which cited four current and former U.S. and foreign officials. Besides the information from the Australians, the probe by the Federal Bureau of Investigation was also propelled by intelligence from other friendly governments, including the British and Dutch, the Times said. Papadopoulos, a Chicago-based international energy lawyer, pleaded guilty on Oct. 30 to lying to FBI agents about contacts with people who claimed to have ties to top Russian officials. It was the first criminal charge alleging links between the Trump campaign and Russia. The White House has played down the former aide’s campaign role, saying it was “extremely limited” and that any actions he took would have been on his own. The New York Times, however, reported that Papadopoulos helped set up a meeting between then-candidate Donald Trump and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and edited the outline of Trump’s first major foreign policy speech in April 2016. The federal investigation, which is now being led by Special Counsel Robert Mueller, has hung over Trump’s White House since he took office almost a year ago. Some Trump allies have recently accused Mueller’s team of being biased against the Republican president. Lawyers for Papadopoulos did not immediately respond to requests by Reuters for comment. Mueller’s office declined to comment. Trump’s White House attorney, Ty Cobb, declined to comment on the New York Times report. “Out of respect for the special counsel and his process, we are not commenting on matters such as this,” he said in a statement. Mueller has charged four Trump associates, including Papadopoulos, in his investigation. Russia has denied interfering in the U.S. election and Trump has said there was no collusion between his campaign and Moscow.</td>\n",

       "      <td>SEATTLE/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump called on the U.S. Postal Service on Friday to charge “much more” to ship packages for Amazon (AMZN.O), picking another fight with an online retail giant he has criticized in the past.     “Why is the United States Post Office, which is losing many billions of dollars a year, while charging Amazon and others so little to deliver their packages, making Amazon richer and the Post Office dumber and poorer? Should be charging MUCH MORE!” Trump wrote on Twitter.  The president’s tweet drew fresh attention to the fragile finances of the Postal Service at a time when tens of millions of parcels have just been shipped all over the country for the holiday season.  The U.S. Postal Service, which runs at a big loss, is an independent agency within the federal government and does not receive tax dollars for operating expenses, according to its website.  Package delivery has become an increasingly important part of its business as the Internet has led to a sharp decline in the amount of first-class letters. The president does not determine postal rates. They are set by the Postal Regulatory Commission, an independent government agency with commissioners selected by the president from both political parties. That panel raised prices on packages by almost 2 percent in November.  Amazon was founded by Jeff Bezos, who remains the chief executive officer of the retail company and is the richest person in the world, according to Bloomberg News. Bezos also owns The Washington Post, a newspaper Trump has repeatedly railed against in his criticisms of the news media. In tweets over the past year, Trump has said the “Amazon Washington Post” fabricated stories. He has said Amazon does not pay sales tax, which is not true, and so hurts other retailers, part of a pattern by the former businessman and reality television host of periodically turning his ire on big American companies since he took office in January. Daniel Ives, a research analyst at GBH Insights, said Trump’s comment could be taken as a warning to the retail giant. However, he said he was not concerned for Amazon. “We do not see any price hikes in the future. However, that is a risk that Amazon is clearly aware of and (it) is building out its distribution (system) aggressively,” he said. Amazon has shown interest in the past in shifting into its own delivery service, including testing drones for deliveries. In 2015, the company spent $11.5 billion on shipping, 46 percent of its total operating expenses that year.  Amazon shares were down 0.86 percent to $1,175.90 by early afternoon. Overall, U.S. stock prices were down slightly on Friday.  Satish Jindel, president of ShipMatrix Inc, which analyzes shipping data, disputed the idea that the Postal Service charges less than United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N) and FedEx Corp (FDX.N), the other biggest players in the parcel delivery business in the United States. Many customers get lower rates from UPS and FedEx than they would get from the post office for comparable services, he said. The Postal Service delivers about 62 percent of Amazon packages, for about 3.5 to 4 million a day during the current peak year-end holiday shipping season, Jindel said. The Seattle-based company and the post office have an agreement in which mail carriers take Amazon packages on the last leg of their journeys, from post offices to customers’ doorsteps. Amazon’s No. 2 carrier is UPS, at 21 percent, and FedEx is third, with 8 percent or so, according to Jindel. Trump’s comment tapped into a debate over whether Postal Service pricing has kept pace with the rise of e-commerce, which has flooded the mail with small packages.Private companies like UPS have long claimed the current system unfairly undercuts their business. Steve Gaut, a spokesman for UPS, noted that the company values its “productive relationship” with the postal service, but that it has filed with the Postal Regulatory Commission its concerns about the postal service’s methods for covering costs. Representatives for Amazon, the White House, the U.S. Postal Service and FedEx declined comment or were not immediately available for comment on Trump’s tweet. According to its annual report, the Postal Service lost $2.74 billion this year, and its deficit has ballooned to $61.86 billion.  While the Postal Service’s revenue for first class mail, marketing mail and periodicals is flat or declining, revenue from package delivery is up 44 percent since 2014 to $19.5 billion in the fiscal year ended Sept. 30, 2017. But it also lost about $2 billion in revenue when a temporary surcharge expired in April 2016. According to a Government Accountability Office report in February, the service is facing growing personnel expenses, particularly $73.4 billion in unfunded pension and benefits liabilities. The Postal Service has not announced any plans to cut costs. By law, the Postal Service has to set prices for package delivery to cover the costs attributable to that service. But the postal service allocates only 5.5 percent of its total costs to its business of shipping packages even though that line of business is 28 percent of its total revenue.</td>\n",

In keeping with a sharp pivot under way among Republicans, U.S. Representative Mark Meadows, speaking on CBS’ “Face the Nation,” drew a hard line on federal spending, which lawmakers are bracing to do battle over in January. When they return from the holidays on Wednesday, lawmakers will begin trying to pass a federal budget in a fight likely to be linked to other issues, such as immigration policy, even as the November congressional election campaigns approach in which Republicans will seek to keep control of Congress. President Donald Trump and his Republicans want a big budget increase in military spending, while Democrats also want proportional increases for non-defense “discretionary” spending on programs that support education, scientific research, infrastructure, public health and environmental protection. “The (Trump) administration has already been willing to say: ‘We’re going to increase non-defense discretionary spending ... by about 7 percent,’” Meadows, chairman of the small but influential House Freedom Caucus, said on the program. “Now, Democrats are saying that’s not enough, we need to give the government a pay raise of 10 to 11 percent. For a fiscal conservative, I don’t see where the rationale is. ... Eventually you run out of other people’s money,” he said. Meadows was among Republicans who voted in late December for their party’s debt-financed tax overhaul, which is expected to balloon the federal budget deficit and add about $1.5 trillion over 10 years to the $20 trillion national debt. “It’s interesting to hear Mark talk about fiscal responsibility,” Democratic U.S. Representative Joseph Crowley said on CBS. Crowley said the Republican tax bill would require the  United States to borrow $1.5 trillion, to be paid off by future generations, to finance tax cuts for corporations and the rich. “This is one of the least ... fiscally responsible bills we’ve ever seen passed in the history of the House of Representatives. I think we’re going to be paying for this for many, many years to come,” Crowley said. Republicans insist the tax package, the biggest U.S. tax overhaul in more than 30 years,  will boost the economy and job growth. House Speaker Paul Ryan, who also supported the tax bill, recently went further than Meadows, making clear in a radio interview that welfare or “entitlement reform,” as the party often calls it, would be a top Republican priority in 2018. In Republican parlance, “entitlement” programs mean food stamps, housing assistance, Medicare and Medicaid health insurance for the elderly, poor and disabled, as well as other programs created by Washington to assist the needy. Democrats seized on Ryan’s early December remarks, saying they showed Republicans would try to pay for their tax overhaul by seeking spending cuts for social programs. But the goals of House Republicans may have to take a back seat to the Senate, where the votes of some Democrats will be needed to approve a budget and prevent a government shutdown. Democrats will use their leverage in the Senate, which Republicans narrowly control, to defend both discretionary non-defense programs and social spending, while tackling the issue of the “Dreamers,” people brought illegally to the country as children. Trump in September put a March 2018 expiration date on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program, which protects the young immigrants from deportation and provides them with work permits. The president has said in recent Twitter messages he wants funding for his proposed Mexican border wall and other immigration law changes in exchange for agreeing to help the Dreamers. Representative Debbie Dingell told CBS she did not favor linking that issue to other policy objectives, such as wall funding. “We need to do DACA clean,” she said.  On Wednesday, Trump aides will meet with congressional leaders to discuss those issues. That will be followed by a weekend of strategy sessions for Trump and Republican leaders on Jan. 6 and 7, the White House said. Trump was also scheduled to meet on Sunday with Florida Republican Governor Rick Scott, who wants more emergency aid. The House has passed an $81 billion aid package after hurricanes in Florida, Texas and Puerto Rico, and wildfires in California. The package far exceeded the $44 billion requested by the Trump administration. The Senate has not yet voted on the aid.    \n",

Two federal appeals courts, one in Washington and one in Virginia, last week rejected the administration’s request to put on hold orders by lower court judges requiring the military to begin accepting transgender recruits on Jan. 1. A Justice Department official said the administration will not challenge those rulings. “The Department of Defense has announced that it will be releasing an independent study of these issues in the coming weeks. So rather than litigate this interim appeal before that occurs, the administration has decided to wait for DOD’s study and will continue to defend the president’s lawful authority in District Court in the meantime,” the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. In September, the Pentagon said it had created a panel of senior officials to study how to implement a directive by Trump to prohibit transgender individuals from serving. The Defense Department has until Feb. 21 to submit a plan to Trump. Lawyers representing currently-serving transgender service members and aspiring recruits said they had expected the administration to appeal the rulings to the conservative-majority Supreme Court, but were hoping that would not happen. Pentagon spokeswoman Heather Babb said in a statement: “As mandated by court order, the Department of Defense is prepared to begin accessing transgender applicants for military service Jan. 1. All applicants must meet all accession standards.” Jennifer Levi, a lawyer with gay, lesbian and transgender advocacy group GLAD, called the decision not to appeal “great news.” “I’m hoping it means the government has come to see that there is no way to justify a ban and that it’s not good for the military or our country,” Levi said. Both GLAD and the American Civil Liberties Union represent plaintiffs in the lawsuits filed against the administration. In a move that appealed to his hard-line conservative supporters, Trump announced in July that he would prohibit transgender people from serving in the military, reversing Democratic President Barack Obama’s policy of accepting them. Trump said on Twitter at the time that the military “cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail.” Four federal judges - in Baltimore, Washington, D.C., Seattle and Riverside, California - have issued rulings blocking Trump’s ban while legal challenges to the Republican president’s policy proceed. The judges said the ban would likely violate the right under the U.S. Constitution to equal protection under the law. The Pentagon on Dec. 8 issued guidelines to recruitment personnel in order to enlist transgender applicants by Jan. 1. The memo outlined medical requirements and specified how the applicants’ sex would be identified and even which undergarments they would wear. The Trump administration previously said in legal papers that the armed forces were not prepared to train thousands of personnel on the medical standards needed to process transgender applicants and might have to accept “some individuals who are not medically fit for service.” The Obama administration had set a deadline of July 1, 2017, to begin accepting transgender recruits. But Trump’s defense secretary, James Mattis, postponed that date to Jan. 1, 2018, which the president’s ban then put off indefinitely. Trump has taken other steps aimed at rolling back transgender rights. In October, his administration said a federal law banning gender-based workplace discrimination does not protect transgender employees, reversing another Obama-era position. In February, Trump rescinded guidance issued by the Obama administration saying that public schools should allow transgender students to use the restroom that corresponds to their gender identity.    \n",

Lindsey Graham, who serves on the Senate armed forces and judiciary committees, said Department of Justice Special Counsel Robert Mueller needs to carry on with his Russia investigation without political interference. “This investigation will go forward. It will be an investigation conducted without political influence,” Graham said on CBS’s Face the Nation news program. “And we all need to let Mr. Mueller do his job. I think he’s the right guy at the right time.”  The question of how Russia may have interfered in the election, and how Trump’s campaign may have had links with or co-ordinated any such effort, has loomed over the White House since Trump took office in January. It shows no sign of receding as Trump prepares for his second year in power, despite intensified rhetoric from some Trump allies in recent weeks accusing Mueller’s team of bias against the Republican president. Trump himself seemed to undercut his supporters in an interview last week with the New York Times in which he said he expected Mueller was “going to be fair.”    Russia’s role in the election and the question of possible links to the Trump campaign are the focus of multiple inquiries in Washington. Three committees of the Senate and the House of Representatives are investigating, as well as Mueller, whose team in May took over an earlier probe launched by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). Several members of the Trump campaign and administration have been convicted or indicted in the investigation.  Trump and his allies deny any collusion with Russia during the campaign, and the Kremlin has denied meddling in the election. Graham said he still wants an examination of the FBI’s use of a dossier on links between Trump and Russia that was compiled by a former British spy, Christopher Steele, which prompted Trump allies and some Republicans to question Mueller’s inquiry.   On Saturday, the New York Times reported that it was not that dossier that triggered an early FBI probe, but a tip from former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos to an Australian diplomat that Russia had damaging information about former Trump rival Hillary Clinton.  “I want somebody to look at the way the Department of Justice used this dossier. It bothers me greatly the way they used it, and I want somebody to look at it,” Graham said. But he said the Russia investigation must continue. “As a matter of fact, it would hurt us if we ignored it,” he said.    \n",

The conversation between Papadopoulos and the diplomat, Alexander Downer, in London was a driving factor behind the FBI’s decision to open a counter-intelligence investigation of Moscow’s contacts with the Trump campaign, the Times reported. Two months after the meeting, Australian officials passed the information that came from Papadopoulos to their American counterparts when leaked Democratic emails began appearing online, according to the newspaper, which cited four current and former U.S. and foreign officials. Besides the information from the Australians, the probe by the Federal Bureau of Investigation was also propelled by intelligence from other friendly governments, including the British and Dutch, the Times said. Papadopoulos, a Chicago-based international energy lawyer, pleaded guilty on Oct. 30 to lying to FBI agents about contacts with people who claimed to have ties to top Russian officials. It was the first criminal charge alleging links between the Trump campaign and Russia. The White House has played down the former aide’s campaign role, saying it was “extremely limited” and that any actions he took would have been on his own. The New York Times, however, reported that Papadopoulos helped set up a meeting between then-candidate Donald Trump and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and edited the outline of Trump’s first major foreign policy speech in April 2016. The federal investigation, which is now being led by Special Counsel Robert Mueller, has hung over Trump’s White House since he took office almost a year ago. Some Trump allies have recently accused Mueller’s team of being biased against the Republican president. Lawyers for Papadopoulos did not immediately respond to requests by Reuters for comment. Mueller’s office declined to comment. Trump’s White House attorney, Ty Cobb, declined to comment on the New York Times report. “Out of respect for the special counsel and his process, we are not commenting on matters such as this,” he said in a statement. Mueller has charged four Trump associates, including Papadopoulos, in his investigation. Russia has denied interfering in the U.S. election and Trump has said there was no collusion between his campaign and Moscow.    \n",
       "4  SEATTLE/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump called on the U.S. Postal Service on Friday to charge “much more” to ship packages for Amazon (AMZN.O), picking another fight with an online retail giant he has criticized in the past.     “Why is the United States Post Office, which is losing many billions of dollars a year, while charging Amazon and others so little to deliver their packages, making Amazon richer and the Post Office dumber and poorer? Should be charging MUCH MORE!” Trump wrote on Twitter.  The president’s tweet drew fresh attention to the fragile finances of the Postal Service at a time when tens of millions of parcels have just been shipped all over the country for the holiday season.  The U.S. Postal Service, which runs at a big loss, is an independent agency within the federal government and does not receive tax dollars for operating expenses, according to its website.  Package delivery has become an increasingly important part of its business as the Internet has led to a sharp decline in the amount of first-class letters. The president does not determine postal rates. They are set by the Postal Regulatory Commission, an independent government agency with commissioners selected by the president from both political parties. That panel raised prices on packages by almost 2 percent in November.  Amazon was founded by Jeff Bezos, who remains the chief executive officer of the retail company and is the richest person in the world, according to Bloomberg News. Bezos also owns The Washington Post, a newspaper Trump has repeatedly railed against in his criticisms of the news media. In tweets over the past year, Trump has said the “Amazon Washington Post” fabricated stories. He has said Amazon does not pay sales tax, which is not true, and so hurts other retailers, part of a pattern by the former businessman and reality television host of periodically turning his ire on big American companies since he took office in January. Daniel Ives, a research analyst at GBH Insights, said Trump’s comment could be taken as a warning to the retail giant. However, he said he was not concerned for Amazon. “We do not see any price hikes in the future. However, that is a risk that Amazon is clearly aware of and (it) is building out its distribution (system) aggressively,” he said. Amazon has shown interest in the past in shifting into its own delivery service, including testing drones for deliveries. In 2015, the company spent $11.5 billion on shipping, 46 percent of its total operating expenses that year.  Amazon shares were down 0.86 percent to $1,175.90 by early afternoon. Overall, U.S. stock prices were down slightly on Friday.  Satish Jindel, president of ShipMatrix Inc, which analyzes shipping data, disputed the idea that the Postal Service charges less than United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N) and FedEx Corp (FDX.N), the other biggest players in the parcel delivery business in the United States. Many customers get lower rates from UPS and FedEx than they would get from the post office for comparable services, he said. The Postal Service delivers about 62 percent of Amazon packages, for about 3.5 to 4 million a day during the current peak year-end holiday shipping season, Jindel said. The Seattle-based company and the post office have an agreement in which mail carriers take Amazon packages on the last leg of their journeys, from post offices to customers’ doorsteps. Amazon’s No. 2 carrier is UPS, at 21 percent, and FedEx is third, with 8 percent or so, according to Jindel. Trump’s comment tapped into a debate over whether Postal Service pricing has kept pace with the rise of e-commerce, which has flooded the mail with small packages.Private companies like UPS have long claimed the current system unfairly undercuts their business. Steve Gaut, a spokesman for UPS, noted that the company values its “productive relationship” with the postal service, but that it has filed with the Postal Regulatory Commission its concerns about the postal service’s methods for covering costs. Representatives for Amazon, the White House, the U.S. Postal Service and FedEx declined comment or were not immediately available for comment on Trump’s tweet. According to its annual report, the Postal Service lost $2.74 billion this year, and its deficit has ballooned to $61.86 billion.  While the Postal Service’s revenue for first class mail, marketing mail and periodicals is flat or declining, revenue from package delivery is up 44 percent since 2014 to $19.5 billion in the fiscal year ended Sept. 30, 2017. But it also lost about $2 billion in revenue when a temporary surcharge expired in April 2016. According to a Government Accountability Office report in February, the service is facing growing personnel expenses, particularly $73.4 billion in unfunded pension and benefits liabilities. The Postal Service has not announced any plans to cut costs. By law, the Postal Service has to set prices for package delivery to cover the costs attributable to that service. But the postal service allocates only 5.5 percent of its total costs to its business of shipping packages even though that line of business is 28 percent of its total revenue.    \n",

      "top     (Reuters) - Highlights for U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration on Thursday: The United States drops a massive GBU-43 bomb, the largest non-nuclear bomb it has ever used in combat, in Afghanistan against a series of caves used by Islamic State militants, the Pentagon says. Trump says Pyongyang is a problem that “will be taken care of” amid speculation that North Korea is on the verge of a sixth nuclear test. Military force cannot resolve tension over North Korea, China warns, while an influential Chinese newspaper urges Pyongyang to halt its nuclear program in exchange for Beijing’s protection. The Trump administration is focusing its North Korea strategy on tougher economic sanctions, possibly including intercepting cargo ships and punishing Chinese banks doing business with Pyongyang, U.S. officials say. Trump says “things will work out fine” between the United States and Russia, a day after declaring U.S.-Russian relations may be at an all-time low. Trump signals he could be moving closer to the mainstream on monetary policy, saying he has not ruled out reappointment of Janet Yellen as Federal Reserve chair as he considers his choices for the U.S. central bank. [nL1N1HL14B] Trump signs a resolution that will allow U.S. states to restrict how federal funds for contraception and reproductive health are spent, a move cheered by anti-abortion campaigners. Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen presses Deutsche Bank to release information about issues including Trump’s debt and any bank meetings with Trump administration officials, saying he has “great concern” about possible conflicts of interest. EXPORT-IMPORT BANK Trump’s office says he plans to revive the hobbled Export-Import Bank of the United States, a victory for American manufacturers such as Boeing Co and General Electric Co that have overseas customers that use the agency’s government-backed loans to purchase their products. Top Wall Street bankers say they are having positive discussions about financial regulation in Washington, and downplay the idea U.S. policymakers may force their institutions to split up. The United States is pushing for trade to be a key issue in top-level economic talks with Japan, a source says, an unwelcome development for Tokyo, which is seeking to fend off U.S. pressure to reduce the bilateral trade imbalance. Trump’s administration has focused on one group of illegal immigrants more than others: women with children, according to eight Department of Homeland Security officials interviewed by Reuters about agency planning.    \n",

He s been under the assumption, like many of us, that the Christopher Steele-dossier was what prompted the Russia investigation so he s been lashing out at the Department of Justice and the FBI in order to protect Trump. As it happens, the dossier is not what started the investigation, according to documents obtained by the New York Times.Former Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos was drunk in a wine bar when he revealed knowledge of Russian opposition research on Hillary Clinton.On top of that, Papadopoulos wasn t just a covfefe boy for Trump, as his administration has alleged. He had a much larger role, but none so damning as being a drunken fool in a wine bar. Coffee boys  don t help to arrange a New York meeting between Trump and President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt two months before the election. It was known before that the former aide set up meetings with world leaders for Trump, but team Trump ran with him being merely a coffee boy.In May 2016, Papadopoulos revealed to Australian diplomat Alexander Downer that Russian officials were shopping around possible dirt on then-Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. Exactly how much Mr. Papadopoulos said that night at the Kensington Wine Rooms with the Australian, Alexander Downer, is unclear,  the report states.  But two months later, when leaked Democratic emails began appearing online, Australian officials passed the information about Mr. Papadopoulos to their American counterparts, according to four current and former American and foreign officials with direct knowledge of the Australians  role. Papadopoulos pleaded guilty to lying to the F.B.I. and is now a cooperating witness with Special Counsel Robert Mueller s team.This isn t a presidency.

The coding contained a reference to Obama and golf:  Unlike Obama, we are working to fix the problem   and not on the golf course.  However, the coding wasn t done correctly.The website of Donald Trump, who has spent several days in a row at the golf course, is coded to serve up the following message in the event of an internal server error: https://t.co/zrWpyMXRcz pic.twitter.com/wiQSQNNzw0  Christopher Ingraham (@_cingraham) December 28, 2017That snippet of code appears to be on all https://t.co/dkhw0AlHB4 pages, which the footer says is paid for by the RNC? pic.twitter.com/oaZDT126B3  Christopher Ingraham (@_cingraham) December 28, 2017It s also all over https://t.co/ayBlGmk65Z.

Christopher Ingraham (@_cingraham) December 28, 2017After the coding was called out, the reference to Obama was deleted.UPDATE: The golf error message has been removed from the Trump and GOP websites. They also fixed the javascript  =  vs  ==  problem. Still not clear when these messages would actually display, since the actual 404 (and presumably 500) page displays a different message pic.twitter.com/Z7dmyQ5smy  Christopher Ingraham (@_cingraham) December 29, 2017That suggests someone at either RNC or the Trump admin is sensitive enough to Trump s golf problem to make this issue go away quickly once people noticed. You have no idea how much I d love to see the email exchange that led us here.  Christopher Ingraham (@_cingraham) December 29, 2017 The code was f-cked up.The best part about this is that they are using the  =  (assignment) operator which means that bit of code will never get run.

       "      <td>Pope Francis used his annual Christmas Day message to rebuke Donald Trump without even mentioning his name. The Pope delivered his message just days after members of the United Nations condemned Trump s move to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. The Pontiff prayed on Monday for the  peaceful coexistence of two states within mutually agreed and internationally recognized borders. We see Jesus in the children of the Middle East who continue to suffer because of growing tensions between Israelis and Palestinians,  Francis said.  On this festive day, let us ask the Lord for peace for Jerusalem and for all the Holy Land. Let us pray that the will to resume dialogue may prevail between the parties and that a negotiated solution can finally be reached. The Pope went on to plead for acceptance of refugees who have been forced from their homes, and that is an issue Trump continues to fight against. Francis used Jesus for which there was  no place in the inn  as an analogy. Today, as the winds of war are blowing in our world and an outdated model of development continues to produce human, societal and environmental decline, Christmas invites us to focus on the sign of the Child and to recognize him in the faces of little children, especially those for whom, like Jesus,  there is no place in the inn,  he said. Jesus knows well the pain of not being welcomed and how hard it is not to have a place to lay one s head,  he added.  May our hearts not be closed as they were in the homes of Bethlehem. The Pope said that Mary and Joseph were immigrants who struggled to find a safe place to stay in Bethlehem. They had to leave their people, their home, and their land,  Francis said.  This was no comfortable or easy journey for a young couple about to have a child.   At heart, they were full of hope and expectation because of the child about to be born; yet their steps were weighed down by the uncertainties and dangers that attend those who have to leave their home behind. So many other footsteps are hidden in the footsteps of Joseph and Mary,  Francis said Sunday. We see the tracks of entire families forced to set out in our own day. We see the tracks of millions of persons who do not choose to go away, but driven from their land, leave behind their dear ones. Amen to that.Photo by Christopher Furlong/Getty Images.</td>\n",

He s been under the assumption, like many of us, that the Christopher Steele-dossier was what prompted the Russia investigation so he s been lashing out at the Department of Justice and the FBI in order to protect Trump. As it happens, the dossier is not what started the investigation, according to documents obtained by the New York Times.Former Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos was drunk in a wine bar when he revealed knowledge of Russian opposition research on Hillary Clinton.On top of that, Papadopoulos wasn t just a covfefe boy for Trump, as his administration has alleged. He had a much larger role, but none so damning as being a drunken fool in a wine bar. Coffee boys  don t help to arrange a New York meeting between Trump and President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt two months before the election. It was known before that the former aide set up meetings with world leaders for Trump, but team Trump ran with him being merely a coffee boy.In May 2016, Papadopoulos revealed to Australian diplomat Alexander Downer that Russian officials were shopping around possible dirt on then-Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. Exactly how much Mr. Papadopoulos said that night at the Kensington Wine Rooms with the Australian, Alexander Downer, is unclear,  the report states.  But two months later, when leaked Democratic emails began appearing online, Australian officials passed the information about Mr. Papadopoulos to their American counterparts, according to four current and former American and foreign officials with direct knowledge of the Australians  role. Papadopoulos pleaded guilty to lying to the F.B.I. and is now a cooperating witness with Special Counsel Robert Mueller s team.This isn t a presidency.

       "2  On Friday, it was revealed that former Milwaukee Sheriff David Clarke, who was being considered for Homeland Security Secretary in Donald Trump s administration, has an email scandal of his own.In January, there was a brief run-in on a plane between Clarke and fellow passenger Dan Black, who he later had detained by the police for no reason whatsoever, except that maybe his feelings were hurt. Clarke messaged the police to stop Black after he deplaned, and now, a search warrant has been executed by the FBI to see the exchanges.Clarke is calling it fake news even though copies of the search warrant are on the Internet.

The former reality show star blasted former President Barack Obama for playing golf and now Trump is on track to outpace the number of golf games his predecessor played.Updated my tracker of Trump s appearances at Trump properties.71 rounds of golf including today s. At this pace, he ll pass Obama s first-term total by July 24 next year. https://t.co/Fg7VacxRtJ pic.twitter.com/5gEMcjQTbH  Philip Bump (@pbump) December 29, 2017 That makes what a Washington Post reporter discovered on Trump s website really weird, but everything about this administration is bizarre AF. The coding contained a reference to Obama and golf:  Unlike Obama, we are working to fix the problem   and not on the golf course.  However, the coding wasn t done correctly.The website of Donald Trump, who has spent several days in a row at the golf course, is coded to serve up the following message in the event of an internal server error: https://t.co/zrWpyMXRcz pic.twitter.com/wiQSQNNzw0  Christopher Ingraham (@_cingraham) December 28, 2017That snippet of code appears to be on all https://t.co/dkhw0AlHB4 pages, which the footer says is paid for by the RNC? pic.twitter.com/oaZDT126B3  Christopher Ingraham (@_cingraham) December 28, 2017It s also all over https://t.co/ayBlGmk65Z. As others have noted in this thread, this is weird code and it s not clear it would ever actually display, but who knows.  Christopher Ingraham (@_cingraham) December 28, 2017After the coding was called out, the reference to Obama was deleted.UPDATE: The golf error message has been removed from the Trump and GOP websites. They also fixed the javascript  =  vs  ==  problem. Still not clear when these messages would actually display, since the actual 404 (and presumably 500) page displays a different message pic.twitter.com/Z7dmyQ5smy  Christopher Ingraham (@_cingraham) December 29, 2017That suggests someone at either RNC or the Trump admin is sensitive enough to Trump s golf problem to make this issue go away quickly once people noticed. You have no idea how much I d love to see the email exchange that led us here.  Christopher Ingraham (@_cingraham) December 29, 2017 The code was f-cked up.The best part about this is that they are using the  =  (assignment) operator which means that bit of code will never get run.

The Pope delivered his message just days after members of the United Nations condemned Trump s move to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. The Pontiff prayed on Monday for the  peaceful coexistence of two states within mutually agreed and internationally recognized borders. We see Jesus in the children of the Middle East who continue to suffer because of growing tensions between Israelis and Palestinians,  Francis said.  On this festive day, let us ask the Lord for peace for Jerusalem and for all the Holy Land. Let us pray that the will to resume dialogue may prevail between the parties and that a negotiated solution can finally be reached. The Pope went on to plead for acceptance of refugees who have been forced from their homes, and that is an issue Trump continues to fight against. Francis used Jesus for which there was  no place in the inn  as an analogy. Today, as the winds of war are blowing in our world and an outdated model of development continues to produce human, societal and environmental decline, Christmas invites us to focus on the sign of the Child and to recognize him in the faces of little children, especially those for whom, like Jesus,  there is no place in the inn,  he said. Jesus knows well the pain of not being welcomed and how hard it is not to have a place to lay one s head,  he added.  May our hearts not be closed as they were in the homes of Bethlehem. The Pope said that Mary and Joseph were immigrants who struggled to find a safe place to stay in Bethlehem. They had to leave their people, their home, and their land,  Francis said.  This was no comfortable or easy journey for a young couple about to have a child.   At heart, they were full of hope and expectation because of the child about to be born; yet their steps were weighed down by the uncertainties and dangers that attend those who have to leave their home behind. So many other footsteps are hidden in the footsteps of Joseph and Mary,  Francis said Sunday. We see the tracks of entire families forced to set out in our own day. We see the tracks of millions of persons who do not choose to go away, but driven from their land, leave behind their dear ones. Amen to that.Photo by Christopher Furlong/Getty Images.   \n",

       "      <td>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The head of a conservative Republican faction in the U.S. Congress, who voted this month for a huge expansion of the national debt to pay for tax cuts, called himself a “fiscal conservative” on Sunday and urged budget restraint in 2018. In keeping with a sharp pivot under way among Republicans, U.S. Representative Mark Meadows, speaking on CBS’ “Face the Nation,” drew a hard line on federal spending, which lawmakers are bracing to do battle over in January. When they return from the holidays on Wednesday, lawmakers will begin trying to pass a federal budget in a fight likely to be linked to other issues, such as immigration policy, even as the November congressional election campaigns approach in which Republicans will seek to keep control of Congress. President Donald Trump and his Republicans want a big budget increase in military spending, while Democrats also want proportional increases for non-defense “discretionary” spending on programs that support education, scientific research, infrastructure, public health and environmental protection. “The (Trump) administration has already been willing to say: ‘We’re going to increase non-defense discretionary spending ... by about 7 percent,’” Meadows, chairman of the small but influential House Freedom Caucus, said on the program. “Now, Democrats are saying that’s not enough, we need to give the government a pay raise of 10 to 11 percent. For a fiscal conservative, I don’t see where the rationale is. ... Eventually you run out of other people’s money,” he said. Meadows was among Republicans who voted in late December for their party’s debt-financed tax overhaul, which is expected to balloon the federal budget deficit and add about $1.5 trillion over 10 years to the $20 trillion national debt. “It’s interesting to hear Mark talk about fiscal responsibility,” Democratic U.S. Representative Joseph Crowley said on CBS. Crowley said the Republican tax bill would require the  United States to borrow $1.5 trillion, to be paid off by future generations, to finance tax cuts for corporations and the rich. “This is one of the least ... fiscally responsible bills we’ve ever seen passed in the history of the House of Representatives. I think we’re going to be paying for this for many, many years to come,” Crowley said. Republicans insist the tax package, the biggest U.S. tax overhaul in more than 30 years,  will boost the economy and job growth. House Speaker Paul Ryan, who also supported the tax bill, recently went further than Meadows, making clear in a radio interview that welfare or “entitlement reform,” as the party often calls it, would be a top Republican priority in 2018. In Republican parlance, “entitlement” programs mean food stamps, housing assistance, Medicare and Medicaid health insurance for the elderly, poor and disabled, as well as other programs created by Washington to assist the needy. Democrats seized on Ryan’s early December remarks, saying they showed Republicans would try to pay for their tax overhaul by seeking spending cuts for social programs. But the goals of House Republicans may have to take a back seat to the Senate, where the votes of some Democrats will be needed to approve a budget and prevent a government shutdown. Democrats will use their leverage in the Senate, which Republicans narrowly control, to defend both discretionary non-defense programs and social spending, while tackling the issue of the “Dreamers,” people brought illegally to the country as children. Trump in September put a March 2018 expiration date on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program, which protects the young immigrants from deportation and provides them with work permits. The president has said in recent Twitter messages he wants funding for his proposed Mexican border wall and other immigration law changes in exchange for agreeing to help the Dreamers. Representative Debbie Dingell told CBS she did not favor linking that issue to other policy objectives, such as wall funding. “We need to do DACA clean,” she said.  On Wednesday, Trump aides will meet with congressional leaders to discuss those issues. That will be followed by a weekend of strategy sessions for Trump and Republican leaders on Jan. 6 and 7, the White House said. Trump was also scheduled to meet on Sunday with Florida Republican Governor Rick Scott, who wants more emergency aid. The House has passed an $81 billion aid package after hurricanes in Florida, Texas and Puerto Rico, and wildfires in California. The package far exceeded the $44 billion requested by the Trump administration. The Senate has not yet voted on the aid.</td>\n",

       "      <td>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Transgender people will be allowed for the first time to enlist in the U.S. military starting on Monday as ordered by federal courts, the Pentagon said on Friday, after President Donald Trump’s administration decided not to appeal rulings that blocked his transgender ban. Two federal appeals courts, one in Washington and one in Virginia, last week rejected the administration’s request to put on hold orders by lower court judges requiring the military to begin accepting transgender recruits on Jan. 1. A Justice Department official said the administration will not challenge those rulings. “The Department of Defense has announced that it will be releasing an independent study of these issues in the coming weeks. So rather than litigate this interim appeal before that occurs, the administration has decided to wait for DOD’s study and will continue to defend the president’s lawful authority in District Court in the meantime,” the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. In September, the Pentagon said it had created a panel of senior officials to study how to implement a directive by Trump to prohibit transgender individuals from serving. The Defense Department has until Feb. 21 to submit a plan to Trump. Lawyers representing currently-serving transgender service members and aspiring recruits said they had expected the administration to appeal the rulings to the conservative-majority Supreme Court, but were hoping that would not happen. Pentagon spokeswoman Heather Babb said in a statement: “As mandated by court order, the Department of Defense is prepared to begin accessing transgender applicants for military service Jan. 1. All applicants must meet all accession standards.” Jennifer Levi, a lawyer with gay, lesbian and transgender advocacy group GLAD, called the decision not to appeal “great news.” “I’m hoping it means the government has come to see that there is no way to justify a ban and that it’s not good for the military or our country,” Levi said. Both GLAD and the American Civil Liberties Union represent plaintiffs in the lawsuits filed against the administration. In a move that appealed to his hard-line conservative supporters, Trump announced in July that he would prohibit transgender people from serving in the military, reversing Democratic President Barack Obama’s policy of accepting them. Trump said on Twitter at the time that the military “cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail.” Four federal judges - in Baltimore, Washington, D.C., Seattle and Riverside, California - have issued rulings blocking Trump’s ban while legal challenges to the Republican president’s policy proceed. The judges said the ban would likely violate the right under the U.S. Constitution to equal protection under the law. The Pentagon on Dec. 8 issued guidelines to recruitment personnel in order to enlist transgender applicants by Jan. 1. The memo outlined medical requirements and specified how the applicants’ sex would be identified and even which undergarments they would wear. The Trump administration previously said in legal papers that the armed forces were not prepared to train thousands of personnel on the medical standards needed to process transgender applicants and might have to accept “some individuals who are not medically fit for service.” The Obama administration had set a deadline of July 1, 2017, to begin accepting transgender recruits. But Trump’s defense secretary, James Mattis, postponed that date to Jan. 1, 2018, which the president’s ban then put off indefinitely. Trump has taken other steps aimed at rolling back transgender rights. In October, his administration said a federal law banning gender-based workplace discrimination does not protect transgender employees, reversing another Obama-era position. In February, Trump rescinded guidance issued by the Obama administration saying that public schools should allow transgender students to use the restroom that corresponds to their gender identity.</td>\n",

       "      <td>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The special counsel investigation of links between Russia and President Trump’s 2016 election campaign should continue without interference in 2018, despite calls from some Trump administration allies and Republican lawmakers to shut it down, a prominent Republican senator said on Sunday. Lindsey Graham, who serves on the Senate armed forces and judiciary committees, said Department of Justice Special Counsel Robert Mueller needs to carry on with his Russia investigation without political interference. “This investigation will go forward. It will be an investigation conducted without political influence,” Graham said on CBS’s Face the Nation news program. “And we all need to let Mr. Mueller do his job. I think he’s the right guy at the right time.”  The question of how Russia may have interfered in the election, and how Trump’s campaign may have had links with or co-ordinated any such effort, has loomed over the White House since Trump took office in January. It shows no sign of receding as Trump prepares for his second year in power, despite intensified rhetoric from some Trump allies in recent weeks accusing Mueller’s team of bias against the Republican president. Trump himself seemed to undercut his supporters in an interview last week with the New York Times in which he said he expected Mueller was “going to be fair.”    Russia’s role in the election and the question of possible links to the Trump campaign are the focus of multiple inquiries in Washington. Three committees of the Senate and the House of Representatives are investigating, as well as Mueller, whose team in May took over an earlier probe launched by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). Several members of the Trump campaign and administration have been convicted or indicted in the investigation.  Trump and his allies deny any collusion with Russia during the campaign, and the Kremlin has denied meddling in the election. Graham said he still wants an examination of the FBI’s use of a dossier on links between Trump and Russia that was compiled by a former British spy, Christopher Steele, which prompted Trump allies and some Republicans to question Mueller’s inquiry.   On Saturday, the New York Times reported that it was not that dossier that triggered an early FBI probe, but a tip from former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos to an Australian diplomat that Russia had damaging information about former Trump rival Hillary Clinton.  “I want somebody to look at the way the Department of Justice used this dossier. It bothers me greatly the way they used it, and I want somebody to look at it,” Graham said. But he said the Russia investigation must continue. “As a matter of fact, it would hurt us if we ignored it,” he said.</td>\n",

       "      <td>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos told an Australian diplomat in May 2016 that Russia had political dirt on Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, the New York Times reported on Saturday. The conversation between Papadopoulos and the diplomat, Alexander Downer, in London was a driving factor behind the FBI’s decision to open a counter-intelligence investigation of Moscow’s contacts with the Trump campaign, the Times reported. Two months after the meeting, Australian officials passed the information that came from Papadopoulos to their American counterparts when leaked Democratic emails began appearing online, according to the newspaper, which cited four current and former U.S. and foreign officials. Besides the information from the Australians, the probe by the Federal Bureau of Investigation was also propelled by intelligence from other friendly governments, including the British and Dutch, the Times said. Papadopoulos, a Chicago-based international energy lawyer, pleaded guilty on Oct. 30 to lying to FBI agents about contacts with people who claimed to have ties to top Russian officials. It was the first criminal charge alleging links between the Trump campaign and Russia. The White House has played down the former aide’s campaign role, saying it was “extremely limited” and that any actions he took would have been on his own. The New York Times, however, reported that Papadopoulos helped set up a meeting between then-candidate Donald Trump and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and edited the outline of Trump’s first major foreign policy speech in April 2016. The federal investigation, which is now being led by Special Counsel Robert Mueller, has hung over Trump’s White House since he took office almost a year ago. Some Trump allies have recently accused Mueller’s team of being biased against the Republican president. Lawyers for Papadopoulos did not immediately respond to requests by Reuters for comment. Mueller’s office declined to comment. Trump’s White House attorney, Ty Cobb, declined to comment on the New York Times report. “Out of respect for the special counsel and his process, we are not commenting on matters such as this,” he said in a statement. Mueller has charged four Trump associates, including Papadopoulos, in his investigation. Russia has denied interfering in the U.S. election and Trump has said there was no collusion between his campaign and Moscow.</td>\n",

       "      <td>SEATTLE/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump called on the U.S. Postal Service on Friday to charge “much more” to ship packages for Amazon (AMZN.O), picking another fight with an online retail giant he has criticized in the past.     “Why is the United States Post Office, which is losing many billions of dollars a year, while charging Amazon and others so little to deliver their packages, making Amazon richer and the Post Office dumber and poorer? Should be charging MUCH MORE!” Trump wrote on Twitter.  The president’s tweet drew fresh attention to the fragile finances of the Postal Service at a time when tens of millions of parcels have just been shipped all over the country for the holiday season.  The U.S. Postal Service, which runs at a big loss, is an independent agency within the federal government and does not receive tax dollars for operating expenses, according to its website.  Package delivery has become an increasingly important part of its business as the Internet has led to a sharp decline in the amount of first-class letters. The president does not determine postal rates. They are set by the Postal Regulatory Commission, an independent government agency with commissioners selected by the president from both political parties. That panel raised prices on packages by almost 2 percent in November.  Amazon was founded by Jeff Bezos, who remains the chief executive officer of the retail company and is the richest person in the world, according to Bloomberg News. Bezos also owns The Washington Post, a newspaper Trump has repeatedly railed against in his criticisms of the news media. In tweets over the past year, Trump has said the “Amazon Washington Post” fabricated stories. He has said Amazon does not pay sales tax, which is not true, and so hurts other retailers, part of a pattern by the former businessman and reality television host of periodically turning his ire on big American companies since he took office in January. Daniel Ives, a research analyst at GBH Insights, said Trump’s comment could be taken as a warning to the retail giant. However, he said he was not concerned for Amazon. “We do not see any price hikes in the future. However, that is a risk that Amazon is clearly aware of and (it) is building out its distribution (system) aggressively,” he said. Amazon has shown interest in the past in shifting into its own delivery service, including testing drones for deliveries. In 2015, the company spent $11.5 billion on shipping, 46 percent of its total operating expenses that year.  Amazon shares were down 0.86 percent to $1,175.90 by early afternoon. Overall, U.S. stock prices were down slightly on Friday.  Satish Jindel, president of ShipMatrix Inc, which analyzes shipping data, disputed the idea that the Postal Service charges less than United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N) and FedEx Corp (FDX.N), the other biggest players in the parcel delivery business in the United States. Many customers get lower rates from UPS and FedEx than they would get from the post office for comparable services, he said. The Postal Service delivers about 62 percent of Amazon packages, for about 3.5 to 4 million a day during the current peak year-end holiday shipping season, Jindel said. The Seattle-based company and the post office have an agreement in which mail carriers take Amazon packages on the last leg of their journeys, from post offices to customers’ doorsteps. Amazon’s No. 2 carrier is UPS, at 21 percent, and FedEx is third, with 8 percent or so, according to Jindel. Trump’s comment tapped into a debate over whether Postal Service pricing has kept pace with the rise of e-commerce, which has flooded the mail with small packages.Private companies like UPS have long claimed the current system unfairly undercuts their business. Steve Gaut, a spokesman for UPS, noted that the company values its “productive relationship” with the postal service, but that it has filed with the Postal Regulatory Commission its concerns about the postal service’s methods for covering costs. Representatives for Amazon, the White House, the U.S. Postal Service and FedEx declined comment or were not immediately available for comment on Trump’s tweet. According to its annual report, the Postal Service lost $2.74 billion this year, and its deficit has ballooned to $61.86 billion.  While the Postal Service’s revenue for first class mail, marketing mail and periodicals is flat or declining, revenue from package delivery is up 44 percent since 2014 to $19.5 billion in the fiscal year ended Sept. 30, 2017. But it also lost about $2 billion in revenue when a temporary surcharge expired in April 2016. According to a Government Accountability Office report in February, the service is facing growing personnel expenses, particularly $73.4 billion in unfunded pension and benefits liabilities. The Postal Service has not announced any plans to cut costs. By law, the Postal Service has to set prices for package delivery to cover the costs attributable to that service. But the postal service allocates only 5.5 percent of its total costs to its business of shipping packages even though that line of business is 28 percent of its total revenue.</td>\n",

In keeping with a sharp pivot under way among Republicans, U.S. Representative Mark Meadows, speaking on CBS’ “Face the Nation,” drew a hard line on federal spending, which lawmakers are bracing to do battle over in January. When they return from the holidays on Wednesday, lawmakers will begin trying to pass a federal budget in a fight likely to be linked to other issues, such as immigration policy, even as the November congressional election campaigns approach in which Republicans will seek to keep control of Congress. President Donald Trump and his Republicans want a big budget increase in military spending, while Democrats also want proportional increases for non-defense “discretionary” spending on programs that support education, scientific research, infrastructure, public health and environmental protection. “The (Trump) administration has already been willing to say: ‘We’re going to increase non-defense discretionary spending ... by about 7 percent,’” Meadows, chairman of the small but influential House Freedom Caucus, said on the program. “Now, Democrats are saying that’s not enough, we need to give the government a pay raise of 10 to 11 percent. For a fiscal conservative, I don’t see where the rationale is. ... Eventually you run out of other people’s money,” he said. Meadows was among Republicans who voted in late December for their party’s debt-financed tax overhaul, which is expected to balloon the federal budget deficit and add about $1.5 trillion over 10 years to the $20 trillion national debt. “It’s interesting to hear Mark talk about fiscal responsibility,” Democratic U.S. Representative Joseph Crowley said on CBS. Crowley said the Republican tax bill would require the  United States to borrow $1.5 trillion, to be paid off by future generations, to finance tax cuts for corporations and the rich. “This is one of the least ... fiscally responsible bills we’ve ever seen passed in the history of the House of Representatives. I think we’re going to be paying for this for many, many years to come,” Crowley said. Republicans insist the tax package, the biggest U.S. tax overhaul in more than 30 years,  will boost the economy and job growth. House Speaker Paul Ryan, who also supported the tax bill, recently went further than Meadows, making clear in a radio interview that welfare or “entitlement reform,” as the party often calls it, would be a top Republican priority in 2018. In Republican parlance, “entitlement” programs mean food stamps, housing assistance, Medicare and Medicaid health insurance for the elderly, poor and disabled, as well as other programs created by Washington to assist the needy. Democrats seized on Ryan’s early December remarks, saying they showed Republicans would try to pay for their tax overhaul by seeking spending cuts for social programs. But the goals of House Republicans may have to take a back seat to the Senate, where the votes of some Democrats will be needed to approve a budget and prevent a government shutdown. Democrats will use their leverage in the Senate, which Republicans narrowly control, to defend both discretionary non-defense programs and social spending, while tackling the issue of the “Dreamers,” people brought illegally to the country as children. Trump in September put a March 2018 expiration date on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program, which protects the young immigrants from deportation and provides them with work permits. The president has said in recent Twitter messages he wants funding for his proposed Mexican border wall and other immigration law changes in exchange for agreeing to help the Dreamers. Representative Debbie Dingell told CBS she did not favor linking that issue to other policy objectives, such as wall funding. “We need to do DACA clean,” she said.  On Wednesday, Trump aides will meet with congressional leaders to discuss those issues. That will be followed by a weekend of strategy sessions for Trump and Republican leaders on Jan. 6 and 7, the White House said. Trump was also scheduled to meet on Sunday with Florida Republican Governor Rick Scott, who wants more emergency aid. The House has passed an $81 billion aid package after hurricanes in Florida, Texas and Puerto Rico, and wildfires in California. The package far exceeded the $44 billion requested by the Trump administration. The Senate has not yet voted on the aid.    \n",

Two federal appeals courts, one in Washington and one in Virginia, last week rejected the administration’s request to put on hold orders by lower court judges requiring the military to begin accepting transgender recruits on Jan. 1. A Justice Department official said the administration will not challenge those rulings. “The Department of Defense has announced that it will be releasing an independent study of these issues in the coming weeks. So rather than litigate this interim appeal before that occurs, the administration has decided to wait for DOD’s study and will continue to defend the president’s lawful authority in District Court in the meantime,” the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. In September, the Pentagon said it had created a panel of senior officials to study how to implement a directive by Trump to prohibit transgender individuals from serving. The Defense Department has until Feb. 21 to submit a plan to Trump. Lawyers representing currently-serving transgender service members and aspiring recruits said they had expected the administration to appeal the rulings to the conservative-majority Supreme Court, but were hoping that would not happen. Pentagon spokeswoman Heather Babb said in a statement: “As mandated by court order, the Department of Defense is prepared to begin accessing transgender applicants for military service Jan. 1. All applicants must meet all accession standards.” Jennifer Levi, a lawyer with gay, lesbian and transgender advocacy group GLAD, called the decision not to appeal “great news.” “I’m hoping it means the government has come to see that there is no way to justify a ban and that it’s not good for the military or our country,” Levi said. Both GLAD and the American Civil Liberties Union represent plaintiffs in the lawsuits filed against the administration. In a move that appealed to his hard-line conservative supporters, Trump announced in July that he would prohibit transgender people from serving in the military, reversing Democratic President Barack Obama’s policy of accepting them. Trump said on Twitter at the time that the military “cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail.” Four federal judges - in Baltimore, Washington, D.C., Seattle and Riverside, California - have issued rulings blocking Trump’s ban while legal challenges to the Republican president’s policy proceed. The judges said the ban would likely violate the right under the U.S. Constitution to equal protection under the law. The Pentagon on Dec. 8 issued guidelines to recruitment personnel in order to enlist transgender applicants by Jan. 1. The memo outlined medical requirements and specified how the applicants’ sex would be identified and even which undergarments they would wear. The Trump administration previously said in legal papers that the armed forces were not prepared to train thousands of personnel on the medical standards needed to process transgender applicants and might have to accept “some individuals who are not medically fit for service.” The Obama administration had set a deadline of July 1, 2017, to begin accepting transgender recruits. But Trump’s defense secretary, James Mattis, postponed that date to Jan. 1, 2018, which the president’s ban then put off indefinitely. Trump has taken other steps aimed at rolling back transgender rights. In October, his administration said a federal law banning gender-based workplace discrimination does not protect transgender employees, reversing another Obama-era position. In February, Trump rescinded guidance issued by the Obama administration saying that public schools should allow transgender students to use the restroom that corresponds to their gender identity.    \n",

Lindsey Graham, who serves on the Senate armed forces and judiciary committees, said Department of Justice Special Counsel Robert Mueller needs to carry on with his Russia investigation without political interference. “This investigation will go forward. It will be an investigation conducted without political influence,” Graham said on CBS’s Face the Nation news program. “And we all need to let Mr. Mueller do his job. I think he’s the right guy at the right time.”  The question of how Russia may have interfered in the election, and how Trump’s campaign may have had links with or co-ordinated any such effort, has loomed over the White House since Trump took office in January. It shows no sign of receding as Trump prepares for his second year in power, despite intensified rhetoric from some Trump allies in recent weeks accusing Mueller’s team of bias against the Republican president. Trump himself seemed to undercut his supporters in an interview last week with the New York Times in which he said he expected Mueller was “going to be fair.”    Russia’s role in the election and the question of possible links to the Trump campaign are the focus of multiple inquiries in Washington. Three committees of the Senate and the House of Representatives are investigating, as well as Mueller, whose team in May took over an earlier probe launched by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). Several members of the Trump campaign and administration have been convicted or indicted in the investigation.  Trump and his allies deny any collusion with Russia during the campaign, and the Kremlin has denied meddling in the election. Graham said he still wants an examination of the FBI’s use of a dossier on links between Trump and Russia that was compiled by a former British spy, Christopher Steele, which prompted Trump allies and some Republicans to question Mueller’s inquiry.   On Saturday, the New York Times reported that it was not that dossier that triggered an early FBI probe, but a tip from former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos to an Australian diplomat that Russia had damaging information about former Trump rival Hillary Clinton.  “I want somebody to look at the way the Department of Justice used this dossier. It bothers me greatly the way they used it, and I want somebody to look at it,” Graham said. But he said the Russia investigation must continue. “As a matter of fact, it would hurt us if we ignored it,” he said.    \n",

The conversation between Papadopoulos and the diplomat, Alexander Downer, in London was a driving factor behind the FBI’s decision to open a counter-intelligence investigation of Moscow’s contacts with the Trump campaign, the Times reported. Two months after the meeting, Australian officials passed the information that came from Papadopoulos to their American counterparts when leaked Democratic emails began appearing online, according to the newspaper, which cited four current and former U.S. and foreign officials. Besides the information from the Australians, the probe by the Federal Bureau of Investigation was also propelled by intelligence from other friendly governments, including the British and Dutch, the Times said. Papadopoulos, a Chicago-based international energy lawyer, pleaded guilty on Oct. 30 to lying to FBI agents about contacts with people who claimed to have ties to top Russian officials. It was the first criminal charge alleging links between the Trump campaign and Russia. The White House has played down the former aide’s campaign role, saying it was “extremely limited” and that any actions he took would have been on his own. The New York Times, however, reported that Papadopoulos helped set up a meeting between then-candidate Donald Trump and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and edited the outline of Trump’s first major foreign policy speech in April 2016. The federal investigation, which is now being led by Special Counsel Robert Mueller, has hung over Trump’s White House since he took office almost a year ago. Some Trump allies have recently accused Mueller’s team of being biased against the Republican president. Lawyers for Papadopoulos did not immediately respond to requests by Reuters for comment. Mueller’s office declined to comment. Trump’s White House attorney, Ty Cobb, declined to comment on the New York Times report. “Out of respect for the special counsel and his process, we are not commenting on matters such as this,” he said in a statement. Mueller has charged four Trump associates, including Papadopoulos, in his investigation. Russia has denied interfering in the U.S. election and Trump has said there was no collusion between his campaign and Moscow.    \n",
       "4  SEATTLE/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump called on the U.S. Postal Service on Friday to charge “much more” to ship packages for Amazon (AMZN.O), picking another fight with an online retail giant he has criticized in the past.     “Why is the United States Post Office, which is losing many billions of dollars a year, while charging Amazon and others so little to deliver their packages, making Amazon richer and the Post Office dumber and poorer? Should be charging MUCH MORE!” Trump wrote on Twitter.  The president’s tweet drew fresh attention to the fragile finances of the Postal Service at a time when tens of millions of parcels have just been shipped all over the country for the holiday season.  The U.S. Postal Service, which runs at a big loss, is an independent agency within the federal government and does not receive tax dollars for operating expenses, according to its website.  Package delivery has become an increasingly important part of its business as the Internet has led to a sharp decline in the amount of first-class letters. The president does not determine postal rates. They are set by the Postal Regulatory Commission, an independent government agency with commissioners selected by the president from both political parties. That panel raised prices on packages by almost 2 percent in November.  Amazon was founded by Jeff Bezos, who remains the chief executive officer of the retail company and is the richest person in the world, according to Bloomberg News. Bezos also owns The Washington Post, a newspaper Trump has repeatedly railed against in his criticisms of the news media. In tweets over the past year, Trump has said the “Amazon Washington Post” fabricated stories. He has said Amazon does not pay sales tax, which is not true, and so hurts other retailers, part of a pattern by the former businessman and reality television host of periodically turning his ire on big American companies since he took office in January. Daniel Ives, a research analyst at GBH Insights, said Trump’s comment could be taken as a warning to the retail giant. However, he said he was not concerned for Amazon. “We do not see any price hikes in the future. However, that is a risk that Amazon is clearly aware of and (it) is building out its distribution (system) aggressively,” he said. Amazon has shown interest in the past in shifting into its own delivery service, including testing drones for deliveries. In 2015, the company spent $11.5 billion on shipping, 46 percent of its total operating expenses that year.  Amazon shares were down 0.86 percent to $1,175.90 by early afternoon. Overall, U.S. stock prices were down slightly on Friday.  Satish Jindel, president of ShipMatrix Inc, which analyzes shipping data, disputed the idea that the Postal Service charges less than United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N) and FedEx Corp (FDX.N), the other biggest players in the parcel delivery business in the United States. Many customers get lower rates from UPS and FedEx than they would get from the post office for comparable services, he said. The Postal Service delivers about 62 percent of Amazon packages, for about 3.5 to 4 million a day during the current peak year-end holiday shipping season, Jindel said. The Seattle-based company and the post office have an agreement in which mail carriers take Amazon packages on the last leg of their journeys, from post offices to customers’ doorsteps. Amazon’s No. 2 carrier is UPS, at 21 percent, and FedEx is third, with 8 percent or so, according to Jindel. Trump’s comment tapped into a debate over whether Postal Service pricing has kept pace with the rise of e-commerce, which has flooded the mail with small packages.Private companies like UPS have long claimed the current system unfairly undercuts their business. Steve Gaut, a spokesman for UPS, noted that the company values its “productive relationship” with the postal service, but that it has filed with the Postal Regulatory Commission its concerns about the postal service’s methods for covering costs. Representatives for Amazon, the White House, the U.S. Postal Service and FedEx declined comment or were not immediately available for comment on Trump’s tweet. According to its annual report, the Postal Service lost $2.74 billion this year, and its deficit has ballooned to $61.86 billion.  While the Postal Service’s revenue for first class mail, marketing mail and periodicals is flat or declining, revenue from package delivery is up 44 percent since 2014 to $19.5 billion in the fiscal year ended Sept. 30, 2017. But it also lost about $2 billion in revenue when a temporary surcharge expired in April 2016. According to a Government Accountability Office report in February, the service is facing growing personnel expenses, particularly $73.4 billion in unfunded pension and benefits liabilities. The Postal Service has not announced any plans to cut costs. By law, the Postal Service has to set prices for package delivery to cover the costs attributable to that service. But the postal service allocates only 5.5 percent of its total costs to its business of shipping packages even though that line of business is 28 percent of its total revenue.    \n",

He s been under the assumption, like many of us, that the Christopher Steele-dossier was what prompted the Russia investigation so he s been lashing out at the Department of Justice and the FBI in order to protect Trump. As it happens, the dossier is not what started the investigation, according to documents obtained by the New York Times.Former Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos was drunk in a wine bar when he revealed knowledge of Russian opposition research on Hillary Clinton.On top of that, Papadopoulos wasn t just a covfefe boy for Trump, as his administration has alleged. He had a much larger role, but none so damning as being a drunken fool in a wine bar. Coffee boys  don t help to arrange a New York meeting between Trump and President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt two months before the election. It was known before that the former aide set up meetings with world leaders for Trump, but team Trump ran with him being merely a coffee boy.In May 2016, Papadopoulos revealed to Australian diplomat Alexander Downer that Russian officials were shopping around possible dirt on then-Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. Exactly how much Mr. Papadopoulos said that night at the Kensington Wine Rooms with the Australian, Alexander Downer, is unclear,  the report states.  But two months later, when leaked Democratic emails began appearing online, Australian officials passed the information about Mr. Papadopoulos to their American counterparts, according to four current and former American and foreign officials with direct knowledge of the Australians  role. Papadopoulos pleaded guilty to lying to the F.B.I. and is now a cooperating witness with Special Counsel Robert Mueller s team.This isn t a presidency.

Clarke messaged the police to stop Black after he deplaned, and now, a search warrant has been executed by the FBI to see the exchanges.Clarke is calling it fake news even though copies of the search warrant are on the Internet.

The former reality show star blasted former President Barack Obama for playing golf and now Trump is on track to outpace the number of golf games his predecessor played.Updated my tracker of Trump s appearances at Trump properties.71 rounds of golf including today s.

The coding contained a reference to Obama and golf:  Unlike Obama, we are working to fix the problem   and not on the golf course.  However, the coding wasn t done correctly.The website of Donald Trump, who has spent several days in a row at the golf course, is coded to serve up the following message in the event of an internal server error: https://t.co/zrWpyMXRcz pic.twitter.com/wiQSQNNzw0  Christopher Ingraham (@_cingraham) December 28, 2017That snippet of code appears to be on all https://t.co/dkhw0AlHB4 pages, which the footer says is paid for by the RNC? pic.twitter.com/oaZDT126B3  Christopher Ingraham (@_cingraham) December 28, 2017It s also all over https://t.co/ayBlGmk65Z. As others have noted in this thread, this is weird code and it s not clear it would ever actually display, but who knows.  Christopher Ingraham (@_cingraham) December 28, 2017After the coding was called out, the reference to Obama was deleted.UPDATE: The golf error message has been removed from the Trump and GOP websites. They also fixed the javascript  =  vs  ==  problem. Still not clear when these messages would actually display, since the actual 404 (and presumably 500) page displays a different message pic.twitter.com/Z7dmyQ5smy  Christopher Ingraham (@_cingraham) December 29, 2017That suggests someone at either RNC or the Trump admin is sensitive enough to Trump s golf problem to make this issue go away quickly once people noticed. You have no idea how much I d love to see the email exchange that led us here.  Christopher Ingraham (@_cingraham) December 29, 2017 The code was f-cked up.The best part about this is that they are using the  =  (assignment) operator which means that bit of code will never get run.

       "      <td>Pope Francis used his annual Christmas Day message to rebuke Donald Trump without even mentioning his name. The Pope delivered his message just days after members of the United Nations condemned Trump s move to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. The Pontiff prayed on Monday for the  peaceful coexistence of two states within mutually agreed and internationally recognized borders. We see Jesus in the children of the Middle East who continue to suffer because of growing tensions between Israelis and Palestinians,  Francis said.  On this festive day, let us ask the Lord for peace for Jerusalem and for all the Holy Land. Let us pray that the will to resume dialogue may prevail between the parties and that a negotiated solution can finally be reached. The Pope went on to plead for acceptance of refugees who have been forced from their homes, and that is an issue Trump continues to fight against. Francis used Jesus for which there was  no place in the inn  as an analogy. Today, as the winds of war are blowing in our world and an outdated model of development continues to produce human, societal and environmental decline, Christmas invites us to focus on the sign of the Child and to recognize him in the faces of little children, especially those for whom, like Jesus,  there is no place in the inn,  he said. Jesus knows well the pain of not being welcomed and how hard it is not to have a place to lay one s head,  he added.  May our hearts not be closed as they were in the homes of Bethlehem. The Pope said that Mary and Joseph were immigrants who struggled to find a safe place to stay in Bethlehem. They had to leave their people, their home, and their land,  Francis said.  This was no comfortable or easy journey for a young couple about to have a child.   At heart, they were full of hope and expectation because of the child about to be born; yet their steps were weighed down by the uncertainties and dangers that attend those who have to leave their home behind. So many other footsteps are hidden in the footsteps of Joseph and Mary,  Francis said Sunday. We see the tracks of entire families forced to set out in our own day. We see the tracks of millions of persons who do not choose to go away, but driven from their land, leave behind their dear ones. Amen to that.Photo by Christopher Furlong/Getty Images.</td>\n",

He s been under the assumption, like many of us, that the Christopher Steele-dossier was what prompted the Russia investigation so he s been lashing out at the Department of Justice and the FBI in order to protect Trump. As it happens, the dossier is not what started the investigation, according to documents obtained by the New York Times.Former Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos was drunk in a wine bar when he revealed knowledge of Russian opposition research on Hillary Clinton.On top of that, Papadopoulos wasn t just a covfefe boy for Trump, as his administration has alleged. He had a much larger role, but none so damning as being a drunken fool in a wine bar. Coffee boys  don t help to arrange a New York meeting between Trump and President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt two months before the election. It was known before that the former aide set up meetings with world leaders for Trump, but team Trump ran with him being merely a coffee boy.In May 2016, Papadopoulos revealed to Australian diplomat Alexander Downer that Russian officials were shopping around possible dirt on then-Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. Exactly how much Mr. Papadopoulos said that night at the Kensington Wine Rooms with the Australian, Alexander Downer, is unclear,  the report states.  But two months later, when leaked Democratic emails began appearing online, Australian officials passed the information about Mr. Papadopoulos to their American counterparts, according to four current and former American and foreign officials with direct knowledge of the Australians  role. Papadopoulos pleaded guilty to lying to the F.B.I. and is now a cooperating witness with Special Counsel Robert Mueller s team.This isn t a presidency.

       "2  On Friday, it was revealed that former Milwaukee Sheriff David Clarke, who was being considered for Homeland Security Secretary in Donald Trump s administration, has an email scandal of his own.In January, there was a brief run-in on a plane between Clarke and fellow passenger Dan Black, who he later had detained by the police for no reason whatsoever, except that maybe his feelings were hurt. Clarke messaged the police to stop Black after he deplaned, and now, a search warrant has been executed by the FBI to see the exchanges.Clarke is calling it fake news even though copies of the search warrant are on the Internet. I am UNINTIMIDATED by lib media attempts to smear and discredit me with their FAKE NEWS reports designed to silence me,  the former sheriff tweeted.  I will continue to poke them in the eye with a sharp stick and bitch slap these scum bags til they get it.

The Pope delivered his message just days after members of the United Nations condemned Trump s move to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. The Pontiff prayed on Monday for the  peaceful coexistence of two states within mutually agreed and internationally recognized borders. We see Jesus in the children of the Middle East who continue to suffer because of growing tensions between Israelis and Palestinians,  Francis said.  On this festive day, let us ask the Lord for peace for Jerusalem and for all the Holy Land. Let us pray that the will to resume dialogue may prevail between the parties and that a negotiated solution can finally be reached. The Pope went on to plead for acceptance of refugees who have been forced from their homes, and that is an issue Trump continues to fight against. Francis used Jesus for which there was  no place in the inn  as an analogy. Today, as the winds of war are blowing in our world and an outdated model of development continues to produce human, societal and environmental decline, Christmas invites us to focus on the sign of the Child and to recognize him in the faces of little children, especially those for whom, like Jesus,  there is no place in the inn,  he said. Jesus knows well the pain of not being welcomed and how hard it is not to have a place to lay one s head,  he added.  May our hearts not be closed as they were in the homes of Bethlehem. The Pope said that Mary and Joseph were immigrants who struggled to find a safe place to stay in Bethlehem. They had to leave their people, their home, and their land,  Francis said.  This was no comfortable or easy journey for a young couple about to have a child.   At heart, they were full of hope and expectation because of the child about to be born; yet their steps were weighed down by the uncertainties and dangers that attend those who have to leave their home behind. So many other footsteps are hidden in the footsteps of Joseph and Mary,  Francis said Sunday. We see the tracks of entire families forced to set out in our own day. We see the tracks of millions of persons who do not choose to go away, but driven from their land, leave behind their dear ones. Amen to that.Photo by Christopher Furlong/Getty Images.   \n",

       "      <td>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The head of a conservative Republican faction in the U.S. Congress, who voted this month for a huge expansion of the national debt to pay for tax cuts, called himself a “fiscal conservative” on Sunday and urged budget restraint in 2018. In keeping with a sharp pivot under way among Republicans, U.S. Representative Mark Meadows, speaking on CBS’ “Face the Nation,” drew a hard line on federal spending, which lawmakers are bracing to do battle over in January. When they return from the holidays on Wednesday, lawmakers will begin trying to pass a federal budget in a fight likely to be linked to other issues, such as immigration policy, even as the November congressional election campaigns approach in which Republicans will seek to keep control of Congress. President Donald Trump and his Republicans want a big budget increase in military spending, while Democrats also want proportional increases for non-defense “discretionary” spending on programs that support education, scientific research, infrastructure, public health and environmental protection. “The (Trump) administration has already been willing to say: ‘We’re going to increase non-defense discretionary spending ... by about 7 percent,’” Meadows, chairman of the small but influential House Freedom Caucus, said on the program. “Now, Democrats are saying that’s not enough, we need to give the government a pay raise of 10 to 11 percent. For a fiscal conservative, I don’t see where the rationale is. ... Eventually you run out of other people’s money,” he said. Meadows was among Republicans who voted in late December for their party’s debt-financed tax overhaul, which is expected to balloon the federal budget deficit and add about $1.5 trillion over 10 years to the $20 trillion national debt. “It’s interesting to hear Mark talk about fiscal responsibility,” Democratic U.S. Representative Joseph Crowley said on CBS. Crowley said the Republican tax bill would require the  United States to borrow $1.5 trillion, to be paid off by future generations, to finance tax cuts for corporations and the rich. “This is one of the least ... fiscally responsible bills we’ve ever seen passed in the history of the House of Representatives. I think we’re going to be paying for this for many, many years to come,” Crowley said. Republicans insist the tax package, the biggest U.S. tax overhaul in more than 30 years,  will boost the economy and job growth. House Speaker Paul Ryan, who also supported the tax bill, recently went further than Meadows, making clear in a radio interview that welfare or “entitlement reform,” as the party often calls it, would be a top Republican priority in 2018. In Republican parlance, “entitlement” programs mean food stamps, housing assistance, Medicare and Medicaid health insurance for the elderly, poor and disabled, as well as other programs created by Washington to assist the needy. Democrats seized on Ryan’s early December remarks, saying they showed Republicans would try to pay for their tax overhaul by seeking spending cuts for social programs. But the goals of House Republicans may have to take a back seat to the Senate, where the votes of some Democrats will be needed to approve a budget and prevent a government shutdown. Democrats will use their leverage in the Senate, which Republicans narrowly control, to defend both discretionary non-defense programs and social spending, while tackling the issue of the “Dreamers,” people brought illegally to the country as children. Trump in September put a March 2018 expiration date on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program, which protects the young immigrants from deportation and provides them with work permits. The president has said in recent Twitter messages he wants funding for his proposed Mexican border wall and other immigration law changes in exchange for agreeing to help the Dreamers. Representative Debbie Dingell told CBS she did not favor linking that issue to other policy objectives, such as wall funding. “We need to do DACA clean,” she said.  On Wednesday, Trump aides will meet with congressional leaders to discuss those issues. That will be followed by a weekend of strategy sessions for Trump and Republican leaders on Jan. 6 and 7, the White House said. Trump was also scheduled to meet on Sunday with Florida Republican Governor Rick Scott, who wants more emergency aid. The House has passed an $81 billion aid package after hurricanes in Florida, Texas and Puerto Rico, and wildfires in California. The package far exceeded the $44 billion requested by the Trump administration. The Senate has not yet voted on the aid.</td>\n",

       "      <td>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Transgender people will be allowed for the first time to enlist in the U.S. military starting on Monday as ordered by federal courts, the Pentagon said on Friday, after President Donald Trump’s administration decided not to appeal rulings that blocked his transgender ban. Two federal appeals courts, one in Washington and one in Virginia, last week rejected the administration’s request to put on hold orders by lower court judges requiring the military to begin accepting transgender recruits on Jan. 1. A Justice Department official said the administration will not challenge those rulings. “The Department of Defense has announced that it will be releasing an independent study of these issues in the coming weeks. So rather than litigate this interim appeal before that occurs, the administration has decided to wait for DOD’s study and will continue to defend the president’s lawful authority in District Court in the meantime,” the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. In September, the Pentagon said it had created a panel of senior officials to study how to implement a directive by Trump to prohibit transgender individuals from serving. The Defense Department has until Feb. 21 to submit a plan to Trump. Lawyers representing currently-serving transgender service members and aspiring recruits said they had expected the administration to appeal the rulings to the conservative-majority Supreme Court, but were hoping that would not happen. Pentagon spokeswoman Heather Babb said in a statement: “As mandated by court order, the Department of Defense is prepared to begin accessing transgender applicants for military service Jan. 1. All applicants must meet all accession standards.” Jennifer Levi, a lawyer with gay, lesbian and transgender advocacy group GLAD, called the decision not to appeal “great news.” “I’m hoping it means the government has come to see that there is no way to justify a ban and that it’s not good for the military or our country,” Levi said. Both GLAD and the American Civil Liberties Union represent plaintiffs in the lawsuits filed against the administration. In a move that appealed to his hard-line conservative supporters, Trump announced in July that he would prohibit transgender people from serving in the military, reversing Democratic President Barack Obama’s policy of accepting them. Trump said on Twitter at the time that the military “cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail.” Four federal judges - in Baltimore, Washington, D.C., Seattle and Riverside, California - have issued rulings blocking Trump’s ban while legal challenges to the Republican president’s policy proceed. The judges said the ban would likely violate the right under the U.S. Constitution to equal protection under the law. The Pentagon on Dec. 8 issued guidelines to recruitment personnel in order to enlist transgender applicants by Jan. 1. The memo outlined medical requirements and specified how the applicants’ sex would be identified and even which undergarments they would wear. The Trump administration previously said in legal papers that the armed forces were not prepared to train thousands of personnel on the medical standards needed to process transgender applicants and might have to accept “some individuals who are not medically fit for service.” The Obama administration had set a deadline of July 1, 2017, to begin accepting transgender recruits. But Trump’s defense secretary, James Mattis, postponed that date to Jan. 1, 2018, which the president’s ban then put off indefinitely. Trump has taken other steps aimed at rolling back transgender rights. In October, his administration said a federal law banning gender-based workplace discrimination does not protect transgender employees, reversing another Obama-era position. In February, Trump rescinded guidance issued by the Obama administration saying that public schools should allow transgender students to use the restroom that corresponds to their gender identity.</td>\n",

       "      <td>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The special counsel investigation of links between Russia and President Trump’s 2016 election campaign should continue without interference in 2018, despite calls from some Trump administration allies and Republican lawmakers to shut it down, a prominent Republican senator said on Sunday. Lindsey Graham, who serves on the Senate armed forces and judiciary committees, said Department of Justice Special Counsel Robert Mueller needs to carry on with his Russia investigation without political interference. “This investigation will go forward. It will be an investigation conducted without political influence,” Graham said on CBS’s Face the Nation news program. “And we all need to let Mr. Mueller do his job. I think he’s the right guy at the right time.”  The question of how Russia may have interfered in the election, and how Trump’s campaign may have had links with or co-ordinated any such effort, has loomed over the White House since Trump took office in January. It shows no sign of receding as Trump prepares for his second year in power, despite intensified rhetoric from some Trump allies in recent weeks accusing Mueller’s team of bias against the Republican president. Trump himself seemed to undercut his supporters in an interview last week with the New York Times in which he said he expected Mueller was “going to be fair.”    Russia’s role in the election and the question of possible links to the Trump campaign are the focus of multiple inquiries in Washington. Three committees of the Senate and the House of Representatives are investigating, as well as Mueller, whose team in May took over an earlier probe launched by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). Several members of the Trump campaign and administration have been convicted or indicted in the investigation.  Trump and his allies deny any collusion with Russia during the campaign, and the Kremlin has denied meddling in the election. Graham said he still wants an examination of the FBI’s use of a dossier on links between Trump and Russia that was compiled by a former British spy, Christopher Steele, which prompted Trump allies and some Republicans to question Mueller’s inquiry.   On Saturday, the New York Times reported that it was not that dossier that triggered an early FBI probe, but a tip from former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos to an Australian diplomat that Russia had damaging information about former Trump rival Hillary Clinton.  “I want somebody to look at the way the Department of Justice used this dossier. It bothers me greatly the way they used it, and I want somebody to look at it,” Graham said. But he said the Russia investigation must continue. “As a matter of fact, it would hurt us if we ignored it,” he said.</td>\n",

Two months after the meeting, Australian officials passed the information that came from Papadopoulos to their American counterparts when leaked Democratic emails began appearing online, according to the newspaper, which cited four current and former U.S. and foreign officials. Besides the information from the Australians, the probe by the Federal Bureau of Investigation was also propelled by intelligence from other friendly governments, including the British and Dutch, the Times said. Papadopoulos, a Chicago-based international energy lawyer, pleaded guilty on Oct. 30 to lying to FBI agents about contacts with people who claimed to have ties to top Russian officials. It was the first criminal charge alleging links between the Trump campaign and Russia. The White House has played down the former aide’s campaign role, saying it was “extremely limited” and that any actions he took would have been on his own. The New York Times, however, reported that Papadopoulos helped set up a meeting between then-candidate Donald Trump and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and edited the outline of Trump’s first major foreign policy speech in April 2016. The federal investigation, which is now being led by Special Counsel Robert Mueller, has hung over Trump’s White House since he took office almost a year ago. Some Trump allies have recently accused Mueller’s team of being biased against the Republican president. Lawyers for Papadopoulos did not immediately respond to requests by Reuters for comment. Mueller’s office declined to comment. Trump’s White House attorney, Ty Cobb, declined to comment on the New York Times report. “Out of respect for the special counsel and his process, we are not commenting on matters such as this,” he said in a statement. Mueller has charged four Trump associates, including Papadopoulos, in his investigation. Russia has denied interfering in the U.S. election and Trump has said there was no collusion between his campaign and Moscow.</td>\n",

       "      <td>SEATTLE/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump called on the U.S. Postal Service on Friday to charge “much more” to ship packages for Amazon (AMZN.O), picking another fight with an online retail giant he has criticized in the past.     “Why is the United States Post Office, which is losing many billions of dollars a year, while charging Amazon and others so little to deliver their packages, making Amazon richer and the Post Office dumber and poorer? Should be charging MUCH MORE!” Trump wrote on Twitter.  The president’s tweet drew fresh attention to the fragile finances of the Postal Service at a time when tens of millions of parcels have just been shipped all over the country for the holiday season.  The U.S. Postal Service, which runs at a big loss, is an independent agency within the federal government and does not receive tax dollars for operating expenses, according to its website.  Package delivery has become an increasingly important part of its business as the Internet has led to a sharp decline in the amount of first-class letters. The president does not determine postal rates. They are set by the Postal Regulatory Commission, an independent government agency with commissioners selected by the president from both political parties. That panel raised prices on packages by almost 2 percent in November.  Amazon was founded by Jeff Bezos, who remains the chief executive officer of the retail company and is the richest person in the world, according to Bloomberg News. Bezos also owns The Washington Post, a newspaper Trump has repeatedly railed against in his criticisms of the news media. In tweets over the past year, Trump has said the “Amazon Washington Post” fabricated stories. He has said Amazon does not pay sales tax, which is not true, and so hurts other retailers, part of a pattern by the former businessman and reality television host of periodically turning his ire on big American companies since he took office in January. Daniel Ives, a research analyst at GBH Insights, said Trump’s comment could be taken as a warning to the retail giant. However, he said he was not concerned for Amazon. “We do not see any price hikes in the future. However, that is a risk that Amazon is clearly aware of and (it) is building out its distribution (system) aggressively,” he said. Amazon has shown interest in the past in shifting into its own delivery service, including testing drones for deliveries. In 2015, the company spent $11.5 billion on shipping, 46 percent of its total operating expenses that year.  Amazon shares were down 0.86 percent to $1,175.90 by early afternoon. Overall, U.S. stock prices were down slightly on Friday.  Satish Jindel, president of ShipMatrix Inc, which analyzes shipping data, disputed the idea that the Postal Service charges less than United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N) and FedEx Corp (FDX.N), the other biggest players in the parcel delivery business in the United States. Many customers get lower rates from UPS and FedEx than they would get from the post office for comparable services, he said. The Postal Service delivers about 62 percent of Amazon packages, for about 3.5 to 4 million a day during the current peak year-end holiday shipping season, Jindel said. The Seattle-based company and the post office have an agreement in which mail carriers take Amazon packages on the last leg of their journeys, from post offices to customers’ doorsteps. Amazon’s No. 2 carrier is UPS, at 21 percent, and FedEx is third, with 8 percent or so, according to Jindel. Trump’s comment tapped into a debate over whether Postal Service pricing has kept pace with the rise of e-commerce, which has flooded the mail with small packages.Private companies like UPS have long claimed the current system unfairly undercuts their business. Steve Gaut, a spokesman for UPS, noted that the company values its “productive relationship” with the postal service, but that it has filed with the Postal Regulatory Commission its concerns about the postal service’s methods for covering costs. Representatives for Amazon, the White House, the U.S. Postal Service and FedEx declined comment or were not immediately available for comment on Trump’s tweet. According to its annual report, the Postal Service lost $2.74 billion this year, and its deficit has ballooned to $61.86 billion.  While the Postal Service’s revenue for first class mail, marketing mail and periodicals is flat or declining, revenue from package delivery is up 44 percent since 2014 to $19.5 billion in the fiscal year ended Sept. 30, 2017. But it also lost about $2 billion in revenue when a temporary surcharge expired in April 2016. According to a Government Accountability Office report in February, the service is facing growing personnel expenses, particularly $73.4 billion in unfunded pension and benefits liabilities. The Postal Service has not announced any plans to cut costs. By law, the Postal Service has to set prices for package delivery to cover the costs attributable to that service. But the postal service allocates only 5.5 percent of its total costs to its business of shipping packages even though that line of business is 28 percent of its total revenue.</td>\n",

In keeping with a sharp pivot under way among Republicans, U.S. Representative Mark Meadows, speaking on CBS’ “Face the Nation,” drew a hard line on federal spending, which lawmakers are bracing to do battle over in January. When they return from the holidays on Wednesday, lawmakers will begin trying to pass a federal budget in a fight likely to be linked to other issues, such as immigration policy, even as the November congressional election campaigns approach in which Republicans will seek to keep control of Congress. President Donald Trump and his Republicans want a big budget increase in military spending, while Democrats also want proportional increases for non-defense “discretionary” spending on programs that support education, scientific research, infrastructure, public health and environmental protection. “The (Trump) administration has already been willing to say: ‘We’re going to increase non-defense discretionary spending ... by about 7 percent,’” Meadows, chairman of the small but influential House Freedom Caucus, said on the program. “Now, Democrats are saying that’s not enough, we need to give the government a pay raise of 10 to 11 percent. For a fiscal conservative, I don’t see where the rationale is. ... Eventually you run out of other people’s money,” he said. Meadows was among Republicans who voted in late December for their party’s debt-financed tax overhaul, which is expected to balloon the federal budget deficit and add about $1.5 trillion over 10 years to the $20 trillion national debt. “It’s interesting to hear Mark talk about fiscal responsibility,” Democratic U.S. Representative Joseph Crowley said on CBS. Crowley said the Republican tax bill would require the  United States to borrow $1.5 trillion, to be paid off by future generations, to finance tax cuts for corporations and the rich. “This is one of the least ... fiscally responsible bills we’ve ever seen passed in the history of the House of Representatives. I think we’re going to be paying for this for many, many years to come,” Crowley said. Republicans insist the tax package, the biggest U.S. tax overhaul in more than 30 years,  will boost the economy and job growth. House Speaker Paul Ryan, who also supported the tax bill, recently went further than Meadows, making clear in a radio interview that welfare or “entitlement reform,” as the party often calls it, would be a top Republican priority in 2018. In Republican parlance, “entitlement” programs mean food stamps, housing assistance, Medicare and Medicaid health insurance for the elderly, poor and disabled, as well as other programs created by Washington to assist the needy. Democrats seized on Ryan’s early December remarks, saying they showed Republicans would try to pay for their tax overhaul by seeking spending cuts for social programs. But the goals of House Republicans may have to take a back seat to the Senate, where the votes of some Democrats will be needed to approve a budget and prevent a government shutdown. Democrats will use their leverage in the Senate, which Republicans narrowly control, to defend both discretionary non-defense programs and social spending, while tackling the issue of the “Dreamers,” people brought illegally to the country as children. Trump in September put a March 2018 expiration date on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program, which protects the young immigrants from deportation and provides them with work permits. The president has said in recent Twitter messages he wants funding for his proposed Mexican border wall and other immigration law changes in exchange for agreeing to help the Dreamers. Representative Debbie Dingell told CBS she did not favor linking that issue to other policy objectives, such as wall funding. “We need to do DACA clean,” she said.  On Wednesday, Trump aides will meet with congressional leaders to discuss those issues. That will be followed by a weekend of strategy sessions for Trump and Republican leaders on Jan. 6 and 7, the White House said. Trump was also scheduled to meet on Sunday with Florida Republican Governor Rick Scott, who wants more emergency aid. The House has passed an $81 billion aid package after hurricanes in Florida, Texas and Puerto Rico, and wildfires in California. The package far exceeded the $44 billion requested by the Trump administration. The Senate has not yet voted on the aid.    \n",

Two federal appeals courts, one in Washington and one in Virginia, last week rejected the administration’s request to put on hold orders by lower court judges requiring the military to begin accepting transgender recruits on Jan. 1. A Justice Department official said the administration will not challenge those rulings. “The Department of Defense has announced that it will be releasing an independent study of these issues in the coming weeks. So rather than litigate this interim appeal before that occurs, the administration has decided to wait for DOD’s study and will continue to defend the president’s lawful authority in District Court in the meantime,” the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. In September, the Pentagon said it had created a panel of senior officials to study how to implement a directive by Trump to prohibit transgender individuals from serving. The Defense Department has until Feb. 21 to submit a plan to Trump. Lawyers representing currently-serving transgender service members and aspiring recruits said they had expected the administration to appeal the rulings to the conservative-majority Supreme Court, but were hoping that would not happen. Pentagon spokeswoman Heather Babb said in a statement: “As mandated by court order, the Department of Defense is prepared to begin accessing transgender applicants for military service Jan. 1. All applicants must meet all accession standards.” Jennifer Levi, a lawyer with gay, lesbian and transgender advocacy group GLAD, called the decision not to appeal “great news.” “I’m hoping it means the government has come to see that there is no way to justify a ban and that it’s not good for the military or our country,” Levi said. Both GLAD and the American Civil Liberties Union represent plaintiffs in the lawsuits filed against the administration. In a move that appealed to his hard-line conservative supporters, Trump announced in July that he would prohibit transgender people from serving in the military, reversing Democratic President Barack Obama’s policy of accepting them. Trump said on Twitter at the time that the military “cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail.” Four federal judges - in Baltimore, Washington, D.C., Seattle and Riverside, California - have issued rulings blocking Trump’s ban while legal challenges to the Republican president’s policy proceed. The judges said the ban would likely violate the right under the U.S. Constitution to equal protection under the law. The Pentagon on Dec. 8 issued guidelines to recruitment personnel in order to enlist transgender applicants by Jan. 1. The memo outlined medical requirements and specified how the applicants’ sex would be identified and even which undergarments they would wear. The Trump administration previously said in legal papers that the armed forces were not prepared to train thousands of personnel on the medical standards needed to process transgender applicants and might have to accept “some individuals who are not medically fit for service.” The Obama administration had set a deadline of July 1, 2017, to begin accepting transgender recruits. But Trump’s defense secretary, James Mattis, postponed that date to Jan. 1, 2018, which the president’s ban then put off indefinitely. Trump has taken other steps aimed at rolling back transgender rights. In October, his administration said a federal law banning gender-based workplace discrimination does not protect transgender employees, reversing another Obama-era position. In February, Trump rescinded guidance issued by the Obama administration saying that public schools should allow transgender students to use the restroom that corresponds to their gender identity.    \n",

Lindsey Graham, who serves on the Senate armed forces and judiciary committees, said Department of Justice Special Counsel Robert Mueller needs to carry on with his Russia investigation without political interference. “This investigation will go forward. It will be an investigation conducted without political influence,” Graham said on CBS’s Face the Nation news program. “And we all need to let Mr. Mueller do his job. I think he’s the right guy at the right time.”  The question of how Russia may have interfered in the election, and how Trump’s campaign may have had links with or co-ordinated any such effort, has loomed over the White House since Trump took office in January. It shows no sign of receding as Trump prepares for his second year in power, despite intensified rhetoric from some Trump allies in recent weeks accusing Mueller’s team of bias against the Republican president. Trump himself seemed to undercut his supporters in an interview last week with the New York Times in which he said he expected Mueller was “going to be fair.”    Russia’s role in the election and the question of possible links to the Trump campaign are the focus of multiple inquiries in Washington. Three committees of the Senate and the House of Representatives are investigating, as well as Mueller, whose team in May took over an earlier probe launched by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). Several members of the Trump campaign and administration have been convicted or indicted in the investigation.  Trump and his allies deny any collusion with Russia during the campaign, and the Kremlin has denied meddling in the election. Graham said he still wants an examination of the FBI’s use of a dossier on links between Trump and Russia that was compiled by a former British spy, Christopher Steele, which prompted Trump allies and some Republicans to question Mueller’s inquiry.   On Saturday, the New York Times reported that it was not that dossier that triggered an early FBI probe, but a tip from former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos to an Australian diplomat that Russia had damaging information about former Trump rival Hillary Clinton.  “I want somebody to look at the way the Department of Justice used this dossier. It bothers me greatly the way they used it, and I want somebody to look at it,” Graham said. But he said the Russia investigation must continue. “As a matter of fact, it would hurt us if we ignored it,” he said.    \n",

The conversation between Papadopoulos and the diplomat, Alexander Downer, in London was a driving factor behind the FBI’s decision to open a counter-intelligence investigation of Moscow’s contacts with the Trump campaign, the Times reported. Two months after the meeting, Australian officials passed the information that came from Papadopoulos to their American counterparts when leaked Democratic emails began appearing online, according to the newspaper, which cited four current and former U.S. and foreign officials. Besides the information from the Australians, the probe by the Federal Bureau of Investigation was also propelled by intelligence from other friendly governments, including the British and Dutch, the Times said. Papadopoulos, a Chicago-based international energy lawyer, pleaded guilty on Oct. 30 to lying to FBI agents about contacts with people who claimed to have ties to top Russian officials. It was the first criminal charge alleging links between the Trump campaign and Russia. The White House has played down the former aide’s campaign role, saying it was “extremely limited” and that any actions he took would have been on his own. The New York Times, however, reported that Papadopoulos helped set up a meeting between then-candidate Donald Trump and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and edited the outline of Trump’s first major foreign policy speech in April 2016. The federal investigation, which is now being led by Special Counsel Robert Mueller, has hung over Trump’s White House since he took office almost a year ago. Some Trump allies have recently accused Mueller’s team of being biased against the Republican president. Lawyers for Papadopoulos did not immediately respond to requests by Reuters for comment. Mueller’s office declined to comment. Trump’s White House attorney, Ty Cobb, declined to comment on the New York Times report. “Out of respect for the special counsel and his process, we are not commenting on matters such as this,” he said in a statement. Mueller has charged four Trump associates, including Papadopoulos, in his investigation. Russia has denied interfering in the U.S. election and Trump has said there was no collusion between his campaign and Moscow.    \n",
       "4  SEATTLE/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump called on the U.S. Postal Service on Friday to charge “much more” to ship packages for Amazon (AMZN.O), picking another fight with an online retail giant he has criticized in the past.     “Why is the United States Post Office, which is losing many billions of dollars a year, while charging Amazon and others so little to deliver their packages, making Amazon richer and the Post Office dumber and poorer? Should be charging MUCH MORE!” Trump wrote on Twitter.  The president’s tweet drew fresh attention to the fragile finances of the Postal Service at a time when tens of millions of parcels have just been shipped all over the country for the holiday season.  The U.S. Postal Service, which runs at a big loss, is an independent agency within the federal government and does not receive tax dollars for operating expenses, according to its website.  Package delivery has become an increasingly important part of its business as the Internet has led to a sharp decline in the amount of first-class letters. The president does not determine postal rates. They are set by the Postal Regulatory Commission, an independent government agency with commissioners selected by the president from both political parties. That panel raised prices on packages by almost 2 percent in November.  Amazon was founded by Jeff Bezos, who remains the chief executive officer of the retail company and is the richest person in the world, according to Bloomberg News. Bezos also owns The Washington Post, a newspaper Trump has repeatedly railed against in his criticisms of the news media. In tweets over the past year, Trump has said the “Amazon Washington Post” fabricated stories. He has said Amazon does not pay sales tax, which is not true, and so hurts other retailers, part of a pattern by the former businessman and reality television host of periodically turning his ire on big American companies since he took office in January. Daniel Ives, a research analyst at GBH Insights, said Trump’s comment could be taken as a warning to the retail giant. However, he said he was not concerned for Amazon. “We do not see any price hikes in the future. However, that is a risk that Amazon is clearly aware of and (it) is building out its distribution (system) aggressively,” he said. Amazon has shown interest in the past in shifting into its own delivery service, including testing drones for deliveries. In 2015, the company spent $11.5 billion on shipping, 46 percent of its total operating expenses that year.  Amazon shares were down 0.86 percent to $1,175.90 by early afternoon. Overall, U.S. stock prices were down slightly on Friday.  Satish Jindel, president of ShipMatrix Inc, which analyzes shipping data, disputed the idea that the Postal Service charges less than United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N) and FedEx Corp (FDX.N), the other biggest players in the parcel delivery business in the United States. Many customers get lower rates from UPS and FedEx than they would get from the post office for comparable services, he said. The Postal Service delivers about 62 percent of Amazon packages, for about 3.5 to 4 million a day during the current peak year-end holiday shipping season, Jindel said. The Seattle-based company and the post office have an agreement in which mail carriers take Amazon packages on the last leg of their journeys, from post offices to customers’ doorsteps. Amazon’s No. 2 carrier is UPS, at 21 percent, and FedEx is third, with 8 percent or so, according to Jindel. Trump’s comment tapped into a debate over whether Postal Service pricing has kept pace with the rise of e-commerce, which has flooded the mail with small packages.Private companies like UPS have long claimed the current system unfairly undercuts their business. Steve Gaut, a spokesman for UPS, noted that the company values its “productive relationship” with the postal service, but that it has filed with the Postal Regulatory Commission its concerns about the postal service’s methods for covering costs. Representatives for Amazon, the White House, the U.S. Postal Service and FedEx declined comment or were not immediately available for comment on Trump’s tweet. According to its annual report, the Postal Service lost $2.74 billion this year, and its deficit has ballooned to $61.86 billion.  While the Postal Service’s revenue for first class mail, marketing mail and periodicals is flat or declining, revenue from package delivery is up 44 percent since 2014 to $19.5 billion in the fiscal year ended Sept. 30, 2017. But it also lost about $2 billion in revenue when a temporary surcharge expired in April 2016. According to a Government Accountability Office report in February, the service is facing growing personnel expenses, particularly $73.4 billion in unfunded pension and benefits liabilities. The Postal Service has not announced any plans to cut costs. By law, the Postal Service has to set prices for package delivery to cover the costs attributable to that service. But the postal service allocates only 5.5 percent of its total costs to its business of shipping packages even though that line of business is 28 percent of its total revenue.    \n",

       "      <td>As U.S. budget fight looms, Republicans flip their fiscal script WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The head of a conservative Republican faction in the U.S. Congress, who voted this month for a huge expansion of the national debt to pay for tax cuts, called himself a “fiscal conservative” on Sunday and urged budget restraint in 2018. In keeping with a sharp pivot under way among Republicans, U.S. Representative Mark Meadows, speaking on CBS’ “Face the Nation,” drew a hard line on federal spending, which lawmakers are bracing to do battle over in January. When they return from the holidays on Wednesday, lawmakers will begin trying to pass a federal budget in a fight likely to be linked to other issues, such as immigration policy, even as the November congressional election campaigns approach in which Republicans will seek to keep control of Congress. President Donald Trump and his Republicans want a big budget increase in military spending, while Democrats also want proportional increases for non-defense “discretionary” spending on programs that support education, scientific research, infrastructure, public health and environmental protection. “The (Trump) administration has already been willing to say: ‘We’re going to increase non-defense discretionary spending ... by about 7 percent,’” Meadows, chairman of the small but influential House Freedom Caucus, said on the program. “Now, Democrats are saying that’s not enough, we need to give the government a pay raise of 10 to 11 percent. For a fiscal conservative, I don’t see where the rationale is. ... Eventually you run out of other people’s money,” he said. Meadows was among Republicans who voted in late December for their party’s debt-financed tax overhaul, which is expected to balloon the federal budget deficit and add about $1.5 trillion over 10 years to the $20 trillion national debt. “It’s interesting to hear Mark talk about fiscal responsibility,” Democratic U.S. Representative Joseph Crowley said on CBS. Crowley said the Republican tax bill would require the  United States to borrow $1.5 trillion, to be paid off by future generations, to finance tax cuts for corporations and the rich. “This is one of the least ... fiscally responsible bills we’ve ever seen passed in the history of the House of Representatives. I think we’re going to be paying for this for many, many years to come,” Crowley said. Republicans insist the tax package, the biggest U.S. tax overhaul in more than 30 years,  will boost the economy and job growth. House Speaker Paul Ryan, who also supported the tax bill, recently went further than Meadows, making clear in a radio interview that welfare or “entitlement reform,” as the party often calls it, would be a top Republican priority in 2018. In Republican parlance, “entitlement” programs mean food stamps, housing assistance, Medicare and Medicaid health insurance for the elderly, poor and disabled, as well as other programs created by Washington to assist the needy. Democrats seized on Ryan’s early December remarks, saying they showed Republicans would try to pay for their tax overhaul by seeking spending cuts for social programs. But the goals of House Republicans may have to take a back seat to the Senate, where the votes of some Democrats will be needed to approve a budget and prevent a government shutdown. Democrats will use their leverage in the Senate, which Republicans narrowly control, to defend both discretionary non-defense programs and social spending, while tackling the issue of the “Dreamers,” people brought illegally to the country as children. Trump in September put a March 2018 expiration date on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program, which protects the young immigrants from deportation and provides them with work permits. The president has said in recent Twitter messages he wants funding for his proposed Mexican border wall and other immigration law changes in exchange for agreeing to help the Dreamers. Representative Debbie Dingell told CBS she did not favor linking that issue to other policy objectives, such as wall funding. “We need to do DACA clean,” she said.  On Wednesday, Trump aides will meet with congressional leaders to discuss those issues. That will be followed by a weekend of strategy sessions for Trump and Republican leaders on Jan. 6 and 7, the White House said. Trump was also scheduled to meet on Sunday with Florida Republican Governor Rick Scott, who wants more emergency aid. The House has passed an $81 billion aid package after hurricanes in Florida, Texas and Puerto Rico, and wildfires in California. The package far exceeded the $44 billion requested by the Trump administration. The Senate has not yet voted on the aid.</td>\n",

       "      <td>U.S. military to accept transgender recruits on Monday: Pentagon WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Transgender people will be allowed for the first time to enlist in the U.S. military starting on Monday as ordered by federal courts, the Pentagon said on Friday, after President Donald Trump’s administration decided not to appeal rulings that blocked his transgender ban. Two federal appeals courts, one in Washington and one in Virginia, last week rejected the administration’s request to put on hold orders by lower court judges requiring the military to begin accepting transgender recruits on Jan. 1. A Justice Department official said the administration will not challenge those rulings. “The Department of Defense has announced that it will be releasing an independent study of these issues in the coming weeks. So rather than litigate this interim appeal before that occurs, the administration has decided to wait for DOD’s study and will continue to defend the president’s lawful authority in District Court in the meantime,” the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. In September, the Pentagon said it had created a panel of senior officials to study how to implement a directive by Trump to prohibit transgender individuals from serving. The Defense Department has until Feb. 21 to submit a plan to Trump. Lawyers representing currently-serving transgender service members and aspiring recruits said they had expected the administration to appeal the rulings to the conservative-majority Supreme Court, but were hoping that would not happen. Pentagon spokeswoman Heather Babb said in a statement: “As mandated by court order, the Department of Defense is prepared to begin accessing transgender applicants for military service Jan. 1. All applicants must meet all accession standards.” Jennifer Levi, a lawyer with gay, lesbian and transgender advocacy group GLAD, called the decision not to appeal “great news.” “I’m hoping it means the government has come to see that there is no way to justify a ban and that it’s not good for the military or our country,” Levi said. Both GLAD and the American Civil Liberties Union represent plaintiffs in the lawsuits filed against the administration. In a move that appealed to his hard-line conservative supporters, Trump announced in July that he would prohibit transgender people from serving in the military, reversing Democratic President Barack Obama’s policy of accepting them. Trump said on Twitter at the time that the military “cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail.” Four federal judges - in Baltimore, Washington, D.C., Seattle and Riverside, California - have issued rulings blocking Trump’s ban while legal challenges to the Republican president’s policy proceed. The judges said the ban would likely violate the right under the U.S. Constitution to equal protection under the law. The Pentagon on Dec. 8 issued guidelines to recruitment personnel in order to enlist transgender applicants by Jan. 1. The memo outlined medical requirements and specified how the applicants’ sex would be identified and even which undergarments they would wear. The Trump administration previously said in legal papers that the armed forces were not prepared to train thousands of personnel on the medical standards needed to process transgender applicants and might have to accept “some individuals who are not medically fit for service.” The Obama administration had set a deadline of July 1, 2017, to begin accepting transgender recruits. But Trump’s defense secretary, James Mattis, postponed that date to Jan. 1, 2018, which the president’s ban then put off indefinitely. Trump has taken other steps aimed at rolling back transgender rights. In October, his administration said a federal law banning gender-based workplace discrimination does not protect transgender employees, reversing another Obama-era position. In February, Trump rescinded guidance issued by the Obama administration saying that public schools should allow transgender students to use the restroom that corresponds to their gender identity.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Senior U.S. Republican senator: 'Let Mr. Mueller do his job' WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The special counsel investigation of links between Russia and President Trump’s 2016 election campaign should continue without interference in 2018, despite calls from some Trump administration allies and Republican lawmakers to shut it down, a prominent Republican senator said on Sunday. Lindsey Graham, who serves on the Senate armed forces and judiciary committees, said Department of Justice Special Counsel Robert Mueller needs to carry on with his Russia investigation without political interference. “This investigation will go forward. It will be an investigation conducted without political influence,” Graham said on CBS’s Face the Nation news program. “And we all need to let Mr. Mueller do his job. I think he’s the right guy at the right time.”  The question of how Russia may have interfered in the election, and how Trump’s campaign may have had links with or co-ordinated any such effort, has loomed over the White House since Trump took office in January. It shows no sign of receding as Trump prepares for his second year in power, despite intensified rhetoric from some Trump allies in recent weeks accusing Mueller’s team of bias against the Republican president. Trump himself seemed to undercut his supporters in an interview last week with the New York Times in which he said he expected Mueller was “going to be fair.”    Russia’s role in the election and the question of possible links to the Trump campaign are the focus of multiple inquiries in Washington. Three committees of the Senate and the House of Representatives are investigating, as well as Mueller, whose team in May took over an earlier probe launched by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). Several members of the Trump campaign and administration have been convicted or indicted in the investigation.  Trump and his allies deny any collusion with Russia during the campaign, and the Kremlin has denied meddling in the election. Graham said he still wants an examination of the FBI’s use of a dossier on links between Trump and Russia that was compiled by a former British spy, Christopher Steele, which prompted Trump allies and some Republicans to question Mueller’s inquiry.   On Saturday, the New York Times reported that it was not that dossier that triggered an early FBI probe, but a tip from former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos to an Australian diplomat that Russia had damaging information about former Trump rival Hillary Clinton.  “I want somebody to look at the way the Department of Justice used this dossier. It bothers me greatly the way they used it, and I want somebody to look at it,” Graham said. But he said the Russia investigation must continue. “As a matter of fact, it would hurt us if we ignored it,” he said.</td>\n",

       "      <td>FBI Russia probe helped by Australian diplomat tip-off: NYT WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos told an Australian diplomat in May 2016 that Russia had political dirt on Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, the New York Times reported on Saturday. The conversation between Papadopoulos and the diplomat, Alexander Downer, in London was a driving factor behind the FBI’s decision to open a counter-intelligence investigation of Moscow’s contacts with the Trump campaign, the Times reported. Two months after the meeting, Australian officials passed the information that came from Papadopoulos to their American counterparts when leaked Democratic emails began appearing online, according to the newspaper, which cited four current and former U.S. and foreign officials. Besides the information from the Australians, the probe by the Federal Bureau of Investigation was also propelled by intelligence from other friendly governments, including the British and Dutch, the Times said. Papadopoulos, a Chicago-based international energy lawyer, pleaded guilty on Oct. 30 to lying to FBI agents about contacts with people who claimed to have ties to top Russian officials. It was the first criminal charge alleging links between the Trump campaign and Russia. The White House has played down the former aide’s campaign role, saying it was “extremely limited” and that any actions he took would have been on his own. The New York Times, however, reported that Papadopoulos helped set up a meeting between then-candidate Donald Trump and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and edited the outline of Trump’s first major foreign policy speech in April 2016. The federal investigation, which is now being led by Special Counsel Robert Mueller, has hung over Trump’s White House since he took office almost a year ago. Some Trump allies have recently accused Mueller’s team of being biased against the Republican president. Lawyers for Papadopoulos did not immediately respond to requests by Reuters for comment. Mueller’s office declined to comment. Trump’s White House attorney, Ty Cobb, declined to comment on the New York Times report. “Out of respect for the special counsel and his process, we are not commenting on matters such as this,” he said in a statement. Mueller has charged four Trump associates, including Papadopoulos, in his investigation. Russia has denied interfering in the U.S. election and Trump has said there was no collusion between his campaign and Moscow.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Trump wants Postal Service to charge 'much more' for Amazon shipments SEATTLE/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump called on the U.S. Postal Service on Friday to charge “much more” to ship packages for Amazon (AMZN.O), picking another fight with an online retail giant he has criticized in the past.     “Why is the United States Post Office, which is losing many billions of dollars a year, while charging Amazon and others so little to deliver their packages, making Amazon richer and the Post Office dumber and poorer? Should be charging MUCH MORE!” Trump wrote on Twitter.  The president’s tweet drew fresh attention to the fragile finances of the Postal Service at a time when tens of millions of parcels have just been shipped all over the country for the holiday season.  The U.S. Postal Service, which runs at a big loss, is an independent agency within the federal government and does not receive tax dollars for operating expenses, according to its website.  Package delivery has become an increasingly important part of its business as the Internet has led to a sharp decline in the amount of first-class letters. The president does not determine postal rates. They are set by the Postal Regulatory Commission, an independent government agency with commissioners selected by the president from both political parties. That panel raised prices on packages by almost 2 percent in November.  Amazon was founded by Jeff Bezos, who remains the chief executive officer of the retail company and is the richest person in the world, according to Bloomberg News. Bezos also owns The Washington Post, a newspaper Trump has repeatedly railed against in his criticisms of the news media. In tweets over the past year, Trump has said the “Amazon Washington Post” fabricated stories. He has said Amazon does not pay sales tax, which is not true, and so hurts other retailers, part of a pattern by the former businessman and reality television host of periodically turning his ire on big American companies since he took office in January. Daniel Ives, a research analyst at GBH Insights, said Trump’s comment could be taken as a warning to the retail giant. However, he said he was not concerned for Amazon. “We do not see any price hikes in the future. However, that is a risk that Amazon is clearly aware of and (it) is building out its distribution (system) aggressively,” he said. Amazon has shown interest in the past in shifting into its own delivery service, including testing drones for deliveries. In 2015, the company spent $11.5 billion on shipping, 46 percent of its total operating expenses that year.  Amazon shares were down 0.86 percent to $1,175.90 by early afternoon. Overall, U.S. stock prices were down slightly on Friday.  Satish Jindel, president of ShipMatrix Inc, which analyzes shipping data, disputed the idea that the Postal Service charges less than United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N) and FedEx Corp (FDX.N), the other biggest players in the parcel delivery business in the United States. Many customers get lower rates from UPS and FedEx than they would get from the post office for comparable services, he said. The Postal Service delivers about 62 percent of Amazon packages, for about 3.5 to 4 million a day during the current peak year-end holiday shipping season, Jindel said. The Seattle-based company and the post office have an agreement in which mail carriers take Amazon packages on the last leg of their journeys, from post offices to customers’ doorsteps. Amazon’s No. 2 carrier is UPS, at 21 percent, and FedEx is third, with 8 percent or so, according to Jindel. Trump’s comment tapped into a debate over whether Postal Service pricing has kept pace with the rise of e-commerce, which has flooded the mail with small packages.Private companies like UPS have long claimed the current system unfairly undercuts their business. Steve Gaut, a spokesman for UPS, noted that the company values its “productive relationship” with the postal service, but that it has filed with the Postal Regulatory Commission its concerns about the postal service’s methods for covering costs. Representatives for Amazon, the White House, the U.S. Postal Service and FedEx declined comment or were not immediately available for comment on Trump’s tweet. According to its annual report, the Postal Service lost $2.74 billion this year, and its deficit has ballooned to $61.86 billion.  While the Postal Service’s revenue for first class mail, marketing mail and periodicals is flat or declining, revenue from package delivery is up 44 percent since 2014 to $19.5 billion in the fiscal year ended Sept. 30, 2017. But it also lost about $2 billion in revenue when a temporary surcharge expired in April 2016. According to a Government Accountability Office report in February, the service is facing growing personnel expenses, particularly $73.4 billion in unfunded pension and benefits liabilities. The Postal Service has not announced any plans to cut costs. By law, the Postal Service has to set prices for package delivery to cover the costs attributable to that service. But the postal service allocates only 5.5 percent of its total costs to its business of shipping packages even though that line of business is 28 percent of its total revenue.</td>\n",

In keeping with a sharp pivot under way among Republicans, U.S. Representative Mark Meadows, speaking on CBS’ “Face the Nation,” drew a hard line on federal spending, which lawmakers are bracing to do battle over in January. When they return from the holidays on Wednesday, lawmakers will begin trying to pass a federal budget in a fight likely to be linked to other issues, such as immigration policy, even as the November congressional election campaigns approach in which Republicans will seek to keep control of Congress. President Donald Trump and his Republicans want a big budget increase in military spending, while Democrats also want proportional increases for non-defense “discretionary” spending on programs that support education, scientific research, infrastructure, public health and environmental protection. “The (Trump) administration has already been willing to say: ‘We’re going to increase non-defense discretionary spending ... by about 7 percent,’” Meadows, chairman of the small but influential House Freedom Caucus, said on the program. “Now, Democrats are saying that’s not enough, we need to give the government a pay raise of 10 to 11 percent. For a fiscal conservative, I don’t see where the rationale is. ... Eventually you run out of other people’s money,” he said. Meadows was among Republicans who voted in late December for their party’s debt-financed tax overhaul, which is expected to balloon the federal budget deficit and add about $1.5 trillion over 10 years to the $20 trillion national debt. “It’s interesting to hear Mark talk about fiscal responsibility,” Democratic U.S. Representative Joseph Crowley said on CBS. Crowley said the Republican tax bill would require the  United States to borrow $1.5 trillion, to be paid off by future generations, to finance tax cuts for corporations and the rich. “This is one of the least ... fiscally responsible bills we’ve ever seen passed in the history of the House of Representatives. I think we’re going to be paying for this for many, many years to come,” Crowley said. Republicans insist the tax package, the biggest U.S. tax overhaul in more than 30 years,  will boost the economy and job growth. House Speaker Paul Ryan, who also supported the tax bill, recently went further than Meadows, making clear in a radio interview that welfare or “entitlement reform,” as the party often calls it, would be a top Republican priority in 2018. In Republican parlance, “entitlement” programs mean food stamps, housing assistance, Medicare and Medicaid health insurance for the elderly, poor and disabled, as well as other programs created by Washington to assist the needy. Democrats seized on Ryan’s early December remarks, saying they showed Republicans would try to pay for their tax overhaul by seeking spending cuts for social programs. But the goals of House Republicans may have to take a back seat to the Senate, where the votes of some Democrats will be needed to approve a budget and prevent a government shutdown. Democrats will use their leverage in the Senate, which Republicans narrowly control, to defend both discretionary non-defense programs and social spending, while tackling the issue of the “Dreamers,” people brought illegally to the country as children. Trump in September put a March 2018 expiration date on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program, which protects the young immigrants from deportation and provides them with work permits. The president has said in recent Twitter messages he wants funding for his proposed Mexican border wall and other immigration law changes in exchange for agreeing to help the Dreamers. Representative Debbie Dingell told CBS she did not favor linking that issue to other policy objectives, such as wall funding. “We need to do DACA clean,” she said.  On Wednesday, Trump aides will meet with congressional leaders to discuss those issues. That will be followed by a weekend of strategy sessions for Trump and Republican leaders on Jan. 6 and 7, the White House said. Trump was also scheduled to meet on Sunday with Florida Republican Governor Rick Scott, who wants more emergency aid. The House has passed an $81 billion aid package after hurricanes in Florida, Texas and Puerto Rico, and wildfires in California. The package far exceeded the $44 billion requested by the Trump administration. The Senate has not yet voted on the aid.   \n",

Two federal appeals courts, one in Washington and one in Virginia, last week rejected the administration’s request to put on hold orders by lower court judges requiring the military to begin accepting transgender recruits on Jan. 1. A Justice Department official said the administration will not challenge those rulings. “The Department of Defense has announced that it will be releasing an independent study of these issues in the coming weeks. So rather than litigate this interim appeal before that occurs, the administration has decided to wait for DOD’s study and will continue to defend the president’s lawful authority in District Court in the meantime,” the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. In September, the Pentagon said it had created a panel of senior officials to study how to implement a directive by Trump to prohibit transgender individuals from serving. The Defense Department has until Feb. 21 to submit a plan to Trump. Lawyers representing currently-serving transgender service members and aspiring recruits said they had expected the administration to appeal the rulings to the conservative-majority Supreme Court, but were hoping that would not happen. Pentagon spokeswoman Heather Babb said in a statement: “As mandated by court order, the Department of Defense is prepared to begin accessing transgender applicants for military service Jan. 1. All applicants must meet all accession standards.” Jennifer Levi, a lawyer with gay, lesbian and transgender advocacy group GLAD, called the decision not to appeal “great news.” “I’m hoping it means the government has come to see that there is no way to justify a ban and that it’s not good for the military or our country,” Levi said. Both GLAD and the American Civil Liberties Union represent plaintiffs in the lawsuits filed against the administration. In a move that appealed to his hard-line conservative supporters, Trump announced in July that he would prohibit transgender people from serving in the military, reversing Democratic President Barack Obama’s policy of accepting them. Trump said on Twitter at the time that the military “cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail.” Four federal judges - in Baltimore, Washington, D.C., Seattle and Riverside, California - have issued rulings blocking Trump’s ban while legal challenges to the Republican president’s policy proceed. The judges said the ban would likely violate the right under the U.S. Constitution to equal protection under the law. The Pentagon on Dec. 8 issued guidelines to recruitment personnel in order to enlist transgender applicants by Jan. 1. The memo outlined medical requirements and specified how the applicants’ sex would be identified and even which undergarments they would wear. The Trump administration previously said in legal papers that the armed forces were not prepared to train thousands of personnel on the medical standards needed to process transgender applicants and might have to accept “some individuals who are not medically fit for service.” The Obama administration had set a deadline of July 1, 2017, to begin accepting transgender recruits. But Trump’s defense secretary, James Mattis, postponed that date to Jan. 1, 2018, which the president’s ban then put off indefinitely. Trump has taken other steps aimed at rolling back transgender rights. In October, his administration said a federal law banning gender-based workplace discrimination does not protect transgender employees, reversing another Obama-era position. In February, Trump rescinded guidance issued by the Obama administration saying that public schools should allow transgender students to use the restroom that corresponds to their gender identity.   \n",

Lindsey Graham, who serves on the Senate armed forces and judiciary committees, said Department of Justice Special Counsel Robert Mueller needs to carry on with his Russia investigation without political interference. “This investigation will go forward. It will be an investigation conducted without political influence,” Graham said on CBS’s Face the Nation news program. “And we all need to let Mr. Mueller do his job. I think he’s the right guy at the right time.”  The question of how Russia may have interfered in the election, and how Trump’s campaign may have had links with or co-ordinated any such effort, has loomed over the White House since Trump took office in January. It shows no sign of receding as Trump prepares for his second year in power, despite intensified rhetoric from some Trump allies in recent weeks accusing Mueller’s team of bias against the Republican president. Trump himself seemed to undercut his supporters in an interview last week with the New York Times in which he said he expected Mueller was “going to be fair.”    Russia’s role in the election and the question of possible links to the Trump campaign are the focus of multiple inquiries in Washington. Three committees of the Senate and the House of Representatives are investigating, as well as Mueller, whose team in May took over an earlier probe launched by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). Several members of the Trump campaign and administration have been convicted or indicted in the investigation.  Trump and his allies deny any collusion with Russia during the campaign, and the Kremlin has denied meddling in the election. Graham said he still wants an examination of the FBI’s use of a dossier on links between Trump and Russia that was compiled by a former British spy, Christopher Steele, which prompted Trump allies and some Republicans to question Mueller’s inquiry.   On Saturday, the New York Times reported that it was not that dossier that triggered an early FBI probe, but a tip from former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos to an Australian diplomat that Russia had damaging information about former Trump rival Hillary Clinton.  “I want somebody to look at the way the Department of Justice used this dossier.

But he said the Russia investigation must continue. “As a matter of fact, it would hurt us if we ignored it,” he said.   \n",

The conversation between Papadopoulos and the diplomat, Alexander Downer, in London was a driving factor behind the FBI’s decision to open a counter-intelligence investigation of Moscow’s contacts with the Trump campaign, the Times reported. Two months after the meeting, Australian officials passed the information that came from Papadopoulos to their American counterparts when leaked Democratic emails began appearing online, according to the newspaper, which cited four current and former U.S. and foreign officials. Besides the information from the Australians, the probe by the Federal Bureau of Investigation was also propelled by intelligence from other friendly governments, including the British and Dutch, the Times said. Papadopoulos, a Chicago-based international energy lawyer, pleaded guilty on Oct. 30 to lying to FBI agents about contacts with people who claimed to have ties to top Russian officials. It was the first criminal charge alleging links between the Trump campaign and Russia. The White House has played down the former aide’s campaign role, saying it was “extremely limited” and that any actions he took would have been on his own. The New York Times, however, reported that Papadopoulos helped set up a meeting between then-candidate Donald Trump and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and edited the outline of Trump’s first major foreign policy speech in April 2016. The federal investigation, which is now being led by Special Counsel Robert Mueller, has hung over Trump’s White House since he took office almost a year ago. Some Trump allies have recently accused Mueller’s team of being biased against the Republican president. Lawyers for Papadopoulos did not immediately respond to requests by Reuters for comment. Mueller’s office declined to comment. Trump’s White House attorney, Ty Cobb, declined to comment on the New York Times report. “Out of respect for the special counsel and his process, we are not commenting on matters such as this,” he said in a statement. Mueller has charged four Trump associates, including Papadopoulos, in his investigation. Russia has denied interfering in the U.S. election and Trump has said there was no collusion between his campaign and Moscow.   \n",
       "4  Trump wants Postal Service to charge 'much more' for Amazon shipments SEATTLE/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump called on the U.S. Postal Service on Friday to charge “much more” to ship packages for Amazon (AMZN.O), picking another fight with an online retail giant he has criticized in the past.     “Why is the United States Post Office, which is losing many billions of dollars a year, while charging Amazon and others so little to deliver their packages, making Amazon richer and the Post Office dumber and poorer? Should be charging MUCH MORE!” Trump wrote on Twitter.  The president’s tweet drew fresh attention to the fragile finances of the Postal Service at a time when tens of millions of parcels have just been shipped all over the country for the holiday season.  The U.S. Postal Service, which runs at a big loss, is an independent agency within the federal government and does not receive tax dollars for operating expenses, according to its website.  Package delivery has become an increasingly important part of its business as the Internet has led to a sharp decline in the amount of first-class letters. The president does not determine postal rates. They are set by the Postal Regulatory Commission, an independent government agency with commissioners selected by the president from both political parties. That panel raised prices on packages by almost 2 percent in November.  Amazon was founded by Jeff Bezos, who remains the chief executive officer of the retail company and is the richest person in the world, according to Bloomberg News. Bezos also owns The Washington Post, a newspaper Trump has repeatedly railed against in his criticisms of the news media. In tweets over the past year, Trump has said the “Amazon Washington Post” fabricated stories. He has said Amazon does not pay sales tax, which is not true, and so hurts other retailers, part of a pattern by the former businessman and reality television host of periodically turning his ire on big American companies since he took office in January. Daniel Ives, a research analyst at GBH Insights, said Trump’s comment could be taken as a warning to the retail giant. However, he said he was not concerned for Amazon. “We do not see any price hikes in the future. However, that is a risk that Amazon is clearly aware of and (it) is building out its distribution (system) aggressively,” he said. Amazon has shown interest in the past in shifting into its own delivery service, including testing drones for deliveries. In 2015, the company spent $11.5 billion on shipping, 46 percent of its total operating expenses that year.  Amazon shares were down 0.86 percent to $1,175.90 by early afternoon. Overall, U.S. stock prices were down slightly on Friday.  Satish Jindel, president of ShipMatrix Inc, which analyzes shipping data, disputed the idea that the Postal Service charges less than United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N) and FedEx Corp (FDX.N), the other biggest players in the parcel delivery business in the United States. Many customers get lower rates from UPS and FedEx than they would get from the post office for comparable services, he said. The Postal Service delivers about 62 percent of Amazon packages, for about 3.5 to 4 million a day during the current peak year-end holiday shipping season, Jindel said. The Seattle-based company and the post office have an agreement in which mail carriers take Amazon packages on the last leg of their journeys, from post offices to customers’ doorsteps. Amazon’s No. 2 carrier is UPS, at 21 percent, and FedEx is third, with 8 percent or so, according to Jindel. Trump’s comment tapped into a debate over whether Postal Service pricing has kept pace with the rise of e-commerce, which has flooded the mail with small packages.Private companies like UPS have long claimed the current system unfairly undercuts their business. Steve Gaut, a spokesman for UPS, noted that the company values its “productive relationship” with the postal service, but that it has filed with the Postal Regulatory Commission its concerns about the postal service’s methods for covering costs. Representatives for Amazon, the White House, the U.S. Postal Service and FedEx declined comment or were not immediately available for comment on Trump’s tweet. According to its annual report, the Postal Service lost $2.74 billion this year, and its deficit has ballooned to $61.86 billion.  While the Postal Service’s revenue for first class mail, marketing mail and periodicals is flat or declining, revenue from package delivery is up 44 percent since 2014 to $19.5 billion in the fiscal year ended Sept. 30, 2017. But it also lost about $2 billion in revenue when a temporary surcharge expired in April 2016. According to a Government Accountability Office report in February, the service is facing growing personnel expenses, particularly $73.4 billion in unfunded pension and benefits liabilities. The Postal Service has not announced any plans to cut costs. By law, the Postal Service has to set prices for package delivery to cover the costs attributable to that service. But the postal service allocates only 5.5 percent of its total costs to its business of shipping packages even though that line of business is 28 percent of its total revenue.   "

to ship packages for amazon amzno picking another fight with an online retail giant he has criticized in the past     “why is the united states post office which is losing many billions of dollars a year while charging amazon and others so little to deliver their packages making amazon richer and the post office dumber and poorer should be charging much more” trump wrote on twitter  the president’s tweet drew fresh attention to the fragile finances of the postal service at a time when tens of millions of parcels have just been shipped all over the country for the holiday season  the us postal service which runs at a big loss is an independent agency within the federal government and does not receive tax dollars for operating expenses according to its website  package delivery has become an increasingly important part of its business as the internet has led to a sharp decline in the amount of firstclass letters the president does not determine postal rates they are set by the postal regulatory commission an independent government agency with commissioners selected by the president from both political parties that panel raised prices on packages by almost  percent in november  amazon was founded by jeff bezos who remains the chief executive officer of the retail company and is the richest person in the world according to bloomberg news bezos also owns the washington post a newspaper trump has repeatedly railed against in his criticisms of the news media in tweets over the past year trump has said the “amazon washington post” fabricated stories he has said amazon does not pay sales tax which is not true and so hurts other retailers part of a pattern by the former businessman and reality television host of periodically turning his ire on big american companies since he took office in january daniel ives a research analyst at gbh insights said trump’s comment could be taken as a warning to the retail giant however he said he was not concerned for amazon “we do not see any price hikes in the future however that is a risk that amazon is clearly aware of and it is building out its distribution system aggressively” he said amazon has shown interest in the past in shifting into its own delivery service including testing drones for deliveries in  the company spent  billion on shipping  percent of its total operating expenses that year  amazon shares were down  percent to  by early afternoon overall us stock prices were down slightly on friday  satish jindel president of shipmatrix inc which analyzes shipping data disputed the idea that the postal service charges less than united parcel service inc upsn and fedex corp fdxn the other biggest players in the parcel delivery business in the united states many customers get lower rates from ups and fedex than they would get from the post office for comparable services he said the postal service delivers about  percent of amazon packages for about  to  million a day during the current peak yearend holiday shipping season jindel said the seattlebased company and the post office have an agreement in which mail carriers take amazon packages on the last leg of their journeys from post offices to customers’ doorsteps amazon’s no  carrier is ups at  percent and fedex is third with  percent or so according to jindel trump’s comment tapped into a debate over whether postal service pricing has kept pace with the rise of ecommerce which has flooded the mail with small packagesprivate companies like ups have long claimed the current system unfairly undercuts their business steve gaut a spokesman for ups noted that the company values its “productive relationship” with the postal service but that it has filed with the postal regulatory commission its concerns about the postal service’s methods for covering costs representatives for amazon the white house the us postal service and fedex declined comment or were not immediately available for comment on trump’s tweet according to its annual report the postal service lost  billion this year and its deficit has ballooned to  billion  while the postal service’s revenue for first class mail marketing mail and periodicals is flat or declining revenue from package delivery is up  percent since  to  billion in the fiscal year ended sept   but it also lost about  billion in revenue when a temporary surcharge expired in april  according to a government accountability office report in february the service is facing growing personnel expenses particularly  billion in unfunded pension and benefits liabilities the postal service has not announced any plans to cut costs by law the postal service has to set prices for package delivery to cover the costs attributable to that service but the postal service allocates only  percent of its total costs to its business of shipping packages even though that line of business is  percent of its total revenue</td>\n",

head of a conservative republican faction in the us congress who voted this month for a huge expansion of the national debt to pay for tax cuts called himself a “fiscal conservative” on sunday and urged budget restraint in  in keeping with a sharp pivot under way among republicans us representative mark meadows speaking on cbs’ “face the nation” drew a hard line on federal spending which lawmakers are bracing to do battle over in january when they return from the holidays on wednesday lawmakers will begin trying to pass a federal budget in a fight likely to be linked to other issues such as immigration policy even as the november congressional election campaigns approach in which republicans will seek to keep control of congress president donald trump and his republicans want a big budget increase in military spending while democrats also want proportional increases for nondefense “discretionary” spending on programs that support education scientific research infrastructure public health and environmental protection “the trump administration has already been willing to say ‘we’re going to increase nondefense discretionary spending  by about  percent’” meadows chairman of the small but influential house freedom caucus said on the program “now democrats are saying that’s not enough we need to give the government a pay raise of  to  percent for a fiscal conservative i don’t see where the rationale is  eventually you run out of other people’s money” he said meadows was among republicans who voted in late december for their party’s debtfinanced tax overhaul which is expected to balloon the federal budget deficit and add about  trillion over  years to the  trillion national debt “it’s interesting to hear mark talk about fiscal responsibility” democratic us representative joseph crowley said on cbs crowley said the republican tax bill would require the  united states to borrow  trillion to be paid off by future generations to finance tax cuts for corporations and the rich “this is one of the least  fiscally responsible bills we’ve ever seen passed in the history of the house of representatives i think we’re going to be paying for this for many many years to come” crowley said republicans insist the tax package the biggest us tax overhaul in more than  years  will boost the economy and job growth house speaker paul ryan who also supported the tax bill recently went further than meadows making clear in a radio interview that welfare or “entitlement reform” as the party often calls it would be a top republican priority in  in republican parlance “entitlement” programs mean food stamps housing assistance medicare and medicaid health insurance for the elderly poor and disabled as well as other programs created by washington to assist the needy democrats seized on ryan’s early december remarks saying they showed republicans would try to pay for their tax overhaul by seeking spending cuts for social programs but the goals of house republicans may have to take a back seat to the senate where the votes of some democrats will be needed to approve a budget and prevent a government shutdown democrats will use their leverage in the senate which republicans narrowly control to defend both discretionary nondefense programs and social spending while tackling the issue of the “dreamers” people brought illegally to the country as children trump in september put a march  expiration date on the deferred action for childhood arrivals or daca program which protects the young immigrants from deportation and provides them with work permits the president has said in recent twitter messages he wants funding for his proposed mexican border wall and other immigration law changes in exchange for agreeing to help the dreamers representative debbie dingell told cbs she did not favor linking that issue to other policy objectives such as wall funding “we need to do daca clean” she said  on wednesday trump aides will meet with congressional leaders to discuss those issues that will be followed by a weekend of strategy sessions for trump and republican leaders on jan  and  the white house said trump was also scheduled to meet on sunday with florida republican governor rick scott who wants more emergency aid the house has passed an  billion aid package after hurricanes in florida texas and puerto rico and wildfires in california the package far exceeded the  billion requested by the trump administration the senate has not yet voted on the aid \n",

starting on monday as ordered by federal courts the pentagon said on friday after president donald trump’s administration decided not to appeal rulings that blocked his transgender ban two federal appeals courts one in washington and one in virginia last week rejected the administration’s request to put on hold orders by lower court judges requiring the military to begin accepting transgender recruits on jan  a justice department official said the administration will not challenge those rulings “the department of defense has announced that it will be releasing an independent study of these issues in the coming weeks so rather than litigate this interim appeal before that occurs the administration has decided to wait for dod’s study and will continue to defend the president’s lawful authority in district court in the meantime” the official said speaking on condition of anonymity in september the pentagon said it had created a panel of senior officials to study how to implement a directive by trump to prohibit transgender individuals from serving the defense department has until feb  to submit a plan to trump lawyers representing currentlyserving transgender service members and aspiring recruits said they had expected the administration to appeal the rulings to the conservativemajority supreme court but were hoping that would not happen pentagon spokeswoman heather babb said in a statement “as mandated by court order the department of defense is prepared to begin accessing transgender applicants for military service jan  all applicants must meet all accession standards” jennifer levi a lawyer with gay lesbian and transgender advocacy group glad called the decision not to appeal “great news” “i’m hoping it means the government has come to see that there is no way to justify a ban and that it’s not good for the military or our country” levi said both glad and the american civil liberties union represent plaintiffs in the lawsuits filed against the administration in a move that appealed to his hardline conservative supporters trump announced in july that he would prohibit transgender people from serving in the military reversing democratic president barack obama’s policy of accepting them trump said on twitter at the time that the military “cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail” four federal judges  in baltimore washington dc seattle and riverside california  have issued rulings blocking trump’s ban while legal challenges to the republican president’s policy proceed the judges said the ban would likely violate the right under the us constitution to equal protection under the law the pentagon on dec  issued guidelines to recruitment personnel in order to enlist transgender applicants by jan  the memo outlined medical requirements and specified how the applicants’ sex would be identified and even which undergarments they would wear the trump administration previously said in legal papers that the armed forces were not prepared to train thousands of personnel on the medical standards needed to process transgender applicants and might have to accept “some individuals who are not medically fit for service” the obama administration had set a deadline of july   to begin accepting transgender recruits but trump’s defense secretary james mattis postponed that date to jan   which the president’s ban then put off indefinitely trump has taken other steps aimed at rolling back transgender rights in october his administration said a federal law banning genderbased workplace discrimination does not protect transgender employees reversing another obamaera position in february trump rescinded guidance issued by the obama administration saying that public schools should allow transgender students to use the restroom that corresponds to their gender identity \n",

links between russia and president trump’s  election campaign should continue without interference in  despite calls from some trump administration allies and republican lawmakers to shut it down a prominent republican senator said on sunday lindsey graham who serves on the senate armed forces and judiciary committees said department of justice special counsel robert mueller needs to carry on with his russia investigation without political interference “this investigation will go forward it will be an investigation conducted without political influence” graham said on cbs’s face the nation news program “and we all need to let mr mueller do his job i think he’s the right guy at the right time”  the question of how russia may have interfered in the election and how trump’s campaign may have had links with or coordinated any such effort has loomed over the white house since trump took office in january it shows no sign of receding as trump prepares for his second year in power despite intensified rhetoric from some trump allies in recent weeks accusing mueller’s team of bias against the republican president trump himself seemed to undercut his supporters in an interview last week with the new york times in which he said he expected mueller was “going to be fair”    russia’s role in the election and the question of possible links to the trump campaign are the focus of multiple inquiries in washington three committees of the senate and the house of representatives are investigating as well as mueller whose team in may took over an earlier probe launched by the us federal bureau of investigation fbi several members of the trump campaign and administration have been convicted or indicted in the investigation  trump and his allies deny any collusion with russia during the campaign and the kremlin has denied meddling in the election graham said he still wants an examination of the fbi’s use of a dossier on links between trump and russia that was compiled by a former british spy christopher steele which prompted trump allies and some republicans to question mueller’s inquiry   on saturday the new york times reported that it was not that dossier that triggered an early fbi probe but a tip from former trump campaign foreign policy adviser george papadopoulos to an australian diplomat that russia had damaging information about former trump rival hillary clinton  “i want somebody to look at the way the department of justice used this dossier it bothers me greatly the way they used it and i want somebody to look at it” graham said but he said the russia investigation must continue “as a matter of fact it would hurt us if we ignored it” he said \n",

              fbi russia probe helped by australian diplomat tipoff nyt washington reuters  trump campaign adviser george papadopoulos told an australian diplomat in may  that russia had political dirt on democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton the new york times reported on saturday the conversation between papadopoulos and the diplomat alexander downer in london was a driving factor behind the fbi’s decision to open a counterintelligence investigation of moscow’s contacts with the trump campaign the times reported two months after the meeting australian officials passed the information that came from papadopoulos to their american counterparts when leaked democratic emails began appearing online according to the newspaper which cited four current and former us and foreign officials besides the information from the australians the probe by the federal bureau of investigation was also propelled by intelligence from other friendly governments including the british and dutch the times said papadopoulos a chicagobased international energy lawyer pleaded guilty on oct  to lying to fbi agents about contacts with people who claimed to have ties to top russian officials it was the first criminal charge alleging links between the trump campaign and russia the white house has played down the former aide’s campaign role saying it was “extremely limited” and that any actions he took would have been on his own the new york times however reported that papadopoulos helped set up a meeting between thencandidate donald trump and egyptian president abdel fattah alsisi and edited the outline of trump’s first major foreign policy speech in april  the federal investigation which is now being led by special counsel robert mueller has hung over trump’s white house since he took office almost a year ago some trump allies have recently accused mueller’s team of being biased against the republican president lawyers for papadopoulos did not immediately respond to requests by reuters for comment mueller’s office declined to comment trump’s white house attorney ty cobb declined to comment on the new york times report “out of respect for the special counsel and his process we are not commenting on matters such as this” he said in a statement mueller has charged four trump associates including papadopoulos in his investigation russia has denied interfering in the us election and trump has said there was no collusion between his campaign and moscow \n",
       "4  trump wants postal service to charge much more for amazon shipments seattlewashington reuters  president donald trump called on the us postal service on friday to charge “much more” to ship packages for amazon amzno picking another fight with an online retail giant he has criticized in the past     “why is the united states post office which is losing many billions of dollars a year while charging amazon and others so little to deliver their packages making amazon richer and the post office dumber and poorer should be charging much more” trump wrote on twitter  the president’s tweet drew fresh attention to the fragile finances of the postal service at a time when tens of millions of parcels have just been shipped all over the country for the holiday season  the us postal service which runs at a big loss is an independent agency within the federal government and does not receive tax dollars for operating expenses according to its website  package delivery has become an increasingly important part of its business as the internet has led to a sharp decline in the amount of firstclass letters the president does not determine postal rates they are set by the postal regulatory commission an independent government agency with commissioners selected by the president from both political parties that panel raised prices on packages by almost  percent in november  amazon was founded by jeff bezos who remains the chief executive officer of the retail company and is the richest person in the world according to bloomberg news bezos also owns the washington post a newspaper trump has repeatedly railed against in his criticisms of the news media in tweets over the past year trump has said the “amazon washington post” fabricated stories he has said amazon does not pay sales tax which is not true and so hurts other retailers part of a pattern by the former businessman and reality television host of periodically turning his ire on big american companies since he took office in january daniel ives a research analyst at gbh insights said trump’s comment could be taken as a warning to the retail giant however he said he was not concerned for amazon “we do not see any price hikes in the future however that is a risk that amazon is clearly aware of and it is building out its distribution system aggressively” he said amazon has shown interest in the past in shifting into its own delivery service including testing drones for deliveries in  the company spent  billion on shipping  percent of its total operating expenses that year  amazon shares were down  percent to  by early afternoon overall us stock prices were down slightly on friday  satish jindel president of shipmatrix inc which analyzes shipping data disputed the idea that the postal service charges less than united parcel service inc upsn and fedex corp fdxn the other biggest players in the parcel delivery business in the united states many customers get lower rates from ups and fedex than they would get from the post office for comparable services he said the postal service delivers about  percent of amazon packages for about  to  million a day during the current peak yearend holiday shipping season jindel said the seattlebased company and the post office have an agreement in which mail carriers take amazon packages on the last leg of their journeys from post offices to customers’ doorsteps amazon’s no  carrier is ups at  percent and fedex is third with  percent or so according to jindel trump’s comment tapped into a debate over whether postal service pricing has kept pace with the rise of ecommerce which has flooded the mail with small packagesprivate companies like ups have long claimed the current system unfairly undercuts their business steve gaut a spokesman for ups noted that the company values its “productive relationship” with the postal service but that it has filed with the postal regulatory commission its concerns about the postal service’s methods for covering costs representatives for amazon the white house the us postal service and fedex declined comment or were not immediately available for comment on trump’s tweet according to its annual report the postal service lost  billion this year and its deficit has ballooned to  billion  while the postal service’s revenue for first class mail marketing mail and periodicals is flat or declining revenue from package delivery is up  percent since  to  billion in the fiscal year ended sept   but it also lost about  billion in revenue when a temporary surcharge expired in april  according to a government accountability office report in february the service is facing growing personnel expenses particularly  billion in unfunded pension and benefits liabilities the postal service has not announced any plans to cut costs by law the postal service has to set prices for package delivery to cover the costs attributable to that service but the postal service allocates only  percent of its total costs to its business of shipping packages even though that line of business is  percent of its total revenue "

to ship packages for amazon amzno picking another fight with an online retail giant he has criticized in the past     “why is the united states post office which is losing many billions of dollars a year while charging amazon and others so little to deliver their packages making amazon richer and the post office dumber and poorer should be charging much more” trump wrote on twitter  the president’s tweet drew fresh attention to the fragile finances of the postal service at a time when tens of millions of parcels have just been shipped all over the country for the holiday season  the us postal service which runs at a big loss is an independent agency within the federal government and does not receive tax dollars for operating expenses according to its website  package delivery has become an increasingly important part of its business as the internet has led to a sharp decline in the amount of firstclass letters the president does not determine postal rates they are set by the postal regulatory commission an independent government agency with commissioners selected by the president from both political parties that panel raised prices on packages by almost  percent in november  amazon was founded by jeff bezos who remains the chief executive officer of the retail company and is the richest person in the world according to bloomberg news bezos also owns the washington post a newspaper trump has repeatedly railed against in his criticisms of the news media in tweets over the past year trump has said the “amazon washington post” fabricated stories he has said amazon does not pay sales tax which is not true and so hurts other retailers part of a pattern by the former businessman and reality television host of periodically turning his ire on big american companies since he took office in january daniel ives a research analyst at gbh insights said trump’s comment could be taken as a warning to the retail giant however he said he was not concerned for amazon “we do not see any price hikes in the future however that is a risk that amazon is clearly aware of and it is building out its distribution system aggressively” he said amazon has shown interest in the past in shifting into its own delivery service including testing drones for deliveries in  the company spent  billion on shipping  percent of its total operating expenses that year  amazon shares were down  percent to  by early afternoon overall us stock prices were down slightly on friday  satish jindel president of shipmatrix inc which analyzes shipping data disputed the idea that the postal service charges less than united parcel service inc upsn and fedex corp fdxn the other biggest players in the parcel delivery business in the united states many customers get lower rates from ups and fedex than they would get from the post office for comparable services he said the postal service delivers about  percent of amazon packages for about  to  million a day during the current peak yearend holiday shipping season jindel said the seattlebased company and the post office have an agreement in which mail carriers take amazon packages on the last leg of their journeys from post offices to customers’ doorsteps amazon’s no  carrier is ups at  percent and fedex is third with  percent or so according to jindel trump’s comment tapped into a debate over whether postal service pricing has kept pace with the rise of ecommerce which has flooded the mail with small packagesprivate companies like ups have long claimed the current system unfairly undercuts their business steve gaut a spokesman for ups noted that the company values its “productive relationship” with the postal service but that it has filed with the postal regulatory commission its concerns about the postal service’s methods for covering costs representatives for amazon the white house the us postal service and fedex declined comment or were not immediately available for comment on trump’s tweet according to its annual report the postal service lost  billion this year and its deficit has ballooned to  billion  while the postal service’s revenue for first class mail marketing mail and periodicals is flat or declining revenue from package delivery is up  percent since  to  billion in the fiscal year ended sept   but it also lost about  billion in revenue when a temporary surcharge expired in april  according to a government accountability office report in february the service is facing growing personnel expenses particularly  billion in unfunded pension and benefits liabilities the postal service has not announced any plans to cut costs by law the postal service has to set prices for package delivery to cover the costs attributable to that service but the postal service allocates only  percent of its total costs to its business of shipping packages even though that line of business is  percent of its total revenue</td>\n",

head of a conservative republican faction in the us congress who voted this month for a huge expansion of the national debt to pay for tax cuts called himself a “fiscal conservative” on sunday and urged budget restraint in  in keeping with a sharp pivot under way among republicans us representative mark meadows speaking on cbs’ “face the nation” drew a hard line on federal spending which lawmakers are bracing to do battle over in january when they return from the holidays on wednesday lawmakers will begin trying to pass a federal budget in a fight likely to be linked to other issues such as immigration policy even as the november congressional election campaigns approach in which republicans will seek to keep control of congress president donald trump and his republicans want a big budget increase in military spending while democrats also want proportional increases for nondefense “discretionary” spending on programs that support education scientific research infrastructure public health and environmental protection “the trump administration has already been willing to say ‘we’re going to increase nondefense discretionary spending  by about  percent’” meadows chairman of the small but influential house freedom caucus said on the program “now democrats are saying that’s not enough we need to give the government a pay raise of  to  percent for a fiscal conservative i don’t see where the rationale is  eventually you run out of other people’s money” he said meadows was among republicans who voted in late december for their party’s debtfinanced tax overhaul which is expected to balloon the federal budget deficit and add about  trillion over  years to the  trillion national debt “it’s interesting to hear mark talk about fiscal responsibility” democratic us representative joseph crowley said on cbs crowley said the republican tax bill would require the  united states to borrow  trillion to be paid off by future generations to finance tax cuts for corporations and the rich “this is one of the least  fiscally responsible bills we’ve ever seen passed in the history of the house of representatives i think we’re going to be paying for this for many many years to come” crowley said republicans insist the tax package the biggest us tax overhaul in more than  years  will boost the economy and job growth house speaker paul ryan who also supported the tax bill recently went further than meadows making clear in a radio interview that welfare or “entitlement reform” as the party often calls it would be a top republican priority in  in republican parlance “entitlement” programs mean food stamps housing assistance medicare and medicaid health insurance for the elderly poor and disabled as well as other programs created by washington to assist the needy democrats seized on ryan’s early december remarks saying they showed republicans would try to pay for their tax overhaul by seeking spending cuts for social programs but the goals of house republicans may have to take a back seat to the senate where the votes of some democrats will be needed to approve a budget and prevent a government shutdown democrats will use their leverage in the senate which republicans narrowly control to defend both discretionary nondefense programs and social spending while tackling the issue of the “dreamers” people brought illegally to the country as children trump in september put a march  expiration date on the deferred action for childhood arrivals or daca program which protects the young immigrants from deportation and provides them with work permits the president has said in recent twitter messages he wants funding for his proposed mexican border wall and other immigration law changes in exchange for agreeing to help the dreamers representative debbie dingell told cbs she did not favor linking that issue to other policy objectives such as wall funding “we need to do daca clean” she said  on wednesday trump aides will meet with congressional leaders to discuss those issues that will be followed by a weekend of strategy sessions for trump and republican leaders on jan  and  the white house said trump was also scheduled to meet on sunday with florida republican governor rick scott who wants more emergency aid the house has passed an  billion aid package after hurricanes in florida texas and puerto rico and wildfires in california the package far exceeded the  billion requested by the trump administration the senate has not yet voted on the aid    \n",

starting on monday as ordered by federal courts the pentagon said on friday after president donald trump’s administration decided not to appeal rulings that blocked his transgender ban two federal appeals courts one in washington and one in virginia last week rejected the administration’s request to put on hold orders by lower court judges requiring the military to begin accepting transgender recruits on jan  a justice department official said the administration will not challenge those rulings “the department of defense has announced that it will be releasing an independent study of these issues in the coming weeks so rather than litigate this interim appeal before that occurs the administration has decided to wait for dod’s study and will continue to defend the president’s lawful authority in district court in the meantime” the official said speaking on condition of anonymity in september the pentagon said it had created a panel of senior officials to study how to implement a directive by trump to prohibit transgender individuals from serving the defense department has until feb  to submit a plan to trump lawyers representing currentlyserving transgender service members and aspiring recruits said they had expected the administration to appeal the rulings to the conservativemajority supreme court but were hoping that would not happen pentagon spokeswoman heather babb said in a statement “as mandated by court order the department of defense is prepared to begin accessing transgender applicants for military service jan  all applicants must meet all accession standards” jennifer levi a lawyer with gay lesbian and transgender advocacy group glad called the decision not to appeal “great news” “i’m hoping it means the government has come to see that there is no way to justify a ban and that it’s not good for the military or our country” levi said both glad and the american civil liberties union represent plaintiffs in the lawsuits filed against the administration in a move that appealed to his hardline conservative supporters trump announced in july that he would prohibit transgender people from serving in the military reversing democratic president barack obama’s policy of accepting them trump said on twitter at the time that the military “cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail” four federal judges  in baltimore washington dc seattle and riverside california  have issued rulings blocking trump’s ban while legal challenges to the republican president’s policy proceed the judges said the ban would likely violate the right under the us constitution to equal protection under the law the pentagon on dec  issued guidelines to recruitment personnel in order to enlist transgender applicants by jan  the memo outlined medical requirements and specified how the applicants’ sex would be identified and even which undergarments they would wear the trump administration previously said in legal papers that the armed forces were not prepared to train thousands of personnel on the medical standards needed to process transgender applicants and might have to accept “some individuals who are not medically fit for service” the obama administration had set a deadline of july   to begin accepting transgender recruits but trump’s defense secretary james mattis postponed that date to jan   which the president’s ban then put off indefinitely trump has taken other steps aimed at rolling back transgender rights in october his administration said a federal law banning genderbased workplace discrimination does not protect transgender employees reversing another obamaera position in february trump rescinded guidance issued by the obama administration saying that public schools should allow transgender students to use the restroom that corresponds to their gender identity    \n",

links between russia and president trump’s  election campaign should continue without interference in  despite calls from some trump administration allies and republican lawmakers to shut it down a prominent republican senator said on sunday lindsey graham who serves on the senate armed forces and judiciary committees said department of justice special counsel robert mueller needs to carry on with his russia investigation without political interference “this investigation will go forward it will be an investigation conducted without political influence” graham said on cbs’s face the nation news program “and we all need to let mr mueller do his job i think he’s the right guy at the right time”  the question of how russia may have interfered in the election and how trump’s campaign may have had links with or coordinated any such effort has loomed over the white house since trump took office in january it shows no sign of receding as trump prepares for his second year in power despite intensified rhetoric from some trump allies in recent weeks accusing mueller’s team of bias against the republican president trump himself seemed to undercut his supporters in an interview last week with the new york times in which he said he expected mueller was “going to be fair”    russia’s role in the election and the question of possible links to the trump campaign are the focus of multiple inquiries in washington three committees of the senate and the house of representatives are investigating as well as mueller whose team in may took over an earlier probe launched by the us federal bureau of investigation fbi several members of the trump campaign and administration have been convicted or indicted in the investigation  trump and his allies deny any collusion with russia during the campaign and the kremlin has denied meddling in the election graham said he still wants an examination of the fbi’s use of a dossier on links between trump and russia that was compiled by a former british spy christopher steele which prompted trump allies and some republicans to question mueller’s inquiry   on saturday the new york times reported that it was not that dossier that triggered an early fbi probe but a tip from former trump campaign foreign policy adviser george papadopoulos to an australian diplomat that russia had damaging information about former trump rival hillary clinton  “i want somebody to look at the way the department of justice used this dossier it bothers me greatly the way they used it and i want somebody to look at it” graham said but he said the russia investigation must continue “as a matter of fact it would hurt us if we ignored it” he said    \n",

              fbi russia probe helped by australian diplomat tipoff nyt washington reuters  trump campaign adviser george papadopoulos told an australian diplomat in may  that russia had political dirt on democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton the new york times reported on saturday the conversation between papadopoulos and the diplomat alexander downer in london was a driving factor behind the fbi’s decision to open a counterintelligence investigation of moscow’s contacts with the trump campaign the times reported two months after the meeting australian officials passed the information that came from papadopoulos to their american counterparts when leaked democratic emails began appearing online according to the newspaper which cited four current and former us and foreign officials besides the information from the australians the probe by the federal bureau of investigation was also propelled by intelligence from other friendly governments including the british and dutch the times said papadopoulos a chicagobased international energy lawyer pleaded guilty on oct  to lying to fbi agents about contacts with people who claimed to have ties to top russian officials it was the first criminal charge alleging links between the trump campaign and russia the white house has played down the former aide’s campaign role saying it was “extremely limited” and that any actions he took would have been on his own the new york times however reported that papadopoulos helped set up a meeting between thencandidate donald trump and egyptian president abdel fattah alsisi and edited the outline of trump’s first major foreign policy speech in april  the federal investigation which is now being led by special counsel robert mueller has hung over trump’s white house since he took office almost a year ago some trump allies have recently accused mueller’s team of being biased against the republican president lawyers for papadopoulos did not immediately respond to requests by reuters for comment mueller’s office declined to comment trump’s white house attorney ty cobb declined to comment on the new york times report “out of respect for the special counsel and his process we are not commenting on matters such as this” he said in a statement mueller has charged four trump associates including papadopoulos in his investigation russia has denied interfering in the us election and trump has said there was no collusion between his campaign and moscow    \n",
       "4  trump wants postal service to charge much more for amazon shipments seattlewashington reuters  president donald trump called on the us postal service on friday to charge “much more” to ship packages for amazon amzno picking another fight with an online retail giant he has criticized in the past     “why is the united states post office which is losing many billions of dollars a year while charging amazon and others so little to deliver their packages making amazon richer and the post office dumber and poorer should be charging much more” trump wrote on twitter  the president’s tweet drew fresh attention to the fragile finances of the postal service at a time when tens of millions of parcels have just been shipped all over the country for the holiday season  the us postal service which runs at a big loss is an independent agency within the federal government and does not receive tax dollars for operating expenses according to its website  package delivery has become an increasingly important part of its business as the internet has led to a sharp decline in the amount of firstclass letters the president does not determine postal rates they are set by the postal regulatory commission an independent government agency with commissioners selected by the president from both political parties that panel raised prices on packages by almost  percent in november  amazon was founded by jeff bezos who remains the chief executive officer of the retail company and is the richest person in the world according to bloomberg news bezos also owns the washington post a newspaper trump has repeatedly railed against in his criticisms of the news media in tweets over the past year trump has said the “amazon washington post” fabricated stories he has said amazon does not pay sales tax which is not true and so hurts other retailers part of a pattern by the former businessman and reality television host of periodically turning his ire on big american companies since he took office in january daniel ives a research analyst at gbh insights said trump’s comment could be taken as a warning to the retail giant however he said he was not concerned for amazon “we do not see any price hikes in the future however that is a risk that amazon is clearly aware of and it is building out its distribution system aggressively” he said amazon has shown interest in the past in shifting into its own delivery service including testing drones for deliveries in  the company spent  billion on shipping  percent of its total operating expenses that year  amazon shares were down  percent to  by early afternoon overall us stock prices were down slightly on friday  satish jindel president of shipmatrix inc which analyzes shipping data disputed the idea that the postal service charges less than united parcel service inc upsn and fedex corp fdxn the other biggest players in the parcel delivery business in the united states many customers get lower rates from ups and fedex than they would get from the post office for comparable services he said the postal service delivers about  percent of amazon packages for about  to  million a day during the current peak yearend holiday shipping season jindel said the seattlebased company and the post office have an agreement in which mail carriers take amazon packages on the last leg of their journeys from post offices to customers’ doorsteps amazon’s no  carrier is ups at  percent and fedex is third with  percent or so according to jindel trump’s comment tapped into a debate over whether postal service pricing has kept pace with the rise of ecommerce which has flooded the mail with small packagesprivate companies like ups have long claimed the current system unfairly undercuts their business steve gaut a spokesman for ups noted that the company values its “productive relationship” with the postal service but that it has filed with the postal regulatory commission its concerns about the postal service’s methods for covering costs representatives for amazon the white house the us postal service and fedex declined comment or were not immediately available for comment on trump’s tweet according to its annual report the postal service lost  billion this year and its deficit has ballooned to  billion  while the postal service’s revenue for first class mail marketing mail and periodicals is flat or declining revenue from package delivery is up  percent since  to  billion in the fiscal year ended sept   but it also lost about  billion in revenue when a temporary surcharge expired in april  according to a government accountability office report in february the service is facing growing personnel expenses particularly  billion in unfunded pension and benefits liabilities the postal service has not announced any plans to cut costs by law the postal service has to set prices for package delivery to cover the costs attributable to that service but the postal service allocates only  percent of its total costs to its business of shipping packages even though that line of business is  percent of its total revenue    \n",

to ship packages for amazon amzno picking another fight with an online retail giant he has criticized in the past     “why is the united states post office which is losing many billions of dollars a year while charging amazon and others so little to deliver their packages making amazon richer and the post office dumber and poorer should be charging much more” trump wrote on twitter  the president’s tweet drew fresh attention to the fragile finances of the postal service at a time when tens of millions of parcels have just been shipped all over the country for the holiday season  the us postal service which runs at a big loss is an independent agency within the federal government and does not receive tax dollars for operating expenses according to its website  package delivery has become an increasingly important part of its business as the internet has led to a sharp decline in the amount of firstclass letters the president does not determine postal rates they are set by the postal regulatory commission an independent government agency with commissioners selected by the president from both political parties that panel raised prices on packages by almost  percent in november  amazon was founded by jeff bezos who remains the chief executive officer of the retail company and is the richest person in the world according to bloomberg news bezos also owns the washington post a newspaper trump has repeatedly railed against in his criticisms of the news media in tweets over the past year trump has said the “amazon washington post” fabricated stories he has said amazon does not pay sales tax which is not true and so hurts other retailers part of a pattern by the former businessman and reality television host of periodically turning his ire on big american companies since he took office in january daniel ives a research analyst at gbh insights said trump’s comment could be taken as a warning to the retail giant however he said he was not concerned for amazon “we do not see any price hikes in the future however that is a risk that amazon is clearly aware of and it is building out its distribution system aggressively” he said amazon has shown interest in the past in shifting into its own delivery service including testing drones for deliveries in  the company spent  billion on shipping  percent of its total operating expenses that year  amazon shares were down  percent to  by early afternoon overall us stock prices were down slightly on friday  satish jindel president of shipmatrix inc which analyzes shipping data disputed the idea that the postal service charges less than united parcel service inc upsn and fedex corp fdxn the other biggest players in the parcel delivery business in the united states many customers get lower rates from ups and fedex than they would get from the post office for comparable services he said the postal service delivers about  percent of amazon packages for about  to  million a day during the current peak yearend holiday shipping season jindel said the seattlebased company and the post office have an agreement in which mail carriers take amazon packages on the last leg of their journeys from post offices to customers’ doorsteps amazon’s no  carrier is ups at  percent and fedex is third with  percent or so according to jindel trump’s comment tapped into a debate over whether postal service pricing has kept pace with the rise of ecommerce which has flooded the mail with small packagesprivate companies like ups have long claimed the current system unfairly undercuts their business steve gaut a spokesman for ups noted that the company values its “productive relationship” with the postal service but that it has filed with the postal regulatory commission its concerns about the postal service’s methods for covering costs representatives for amazon the white house the us postal service and fedex declined comment or were not immediately available for comment on trump’s tweet according to its annual report the postal service lost  billion this year and its deficit has ballooned to  billion  while the postal service’s revenue for first class mail marketing mail and periodicals is flat or declining revenue from package delivery is up  percent since  to  billion in the fiscal year ended sept   but it also lost about  billion in revenue when a temporary surcharge expired in april  according to a government accountability office report in february the service is facing growing personnel expenses particularly  billion in unfunded pension and benefits liabilities the postal service has not announced any plans to cut costs by law the postal service has to set prices for package delivery to cover the costs attributable to that service but the postal service allocates only  percent of its total costs to its business of shipping packages even though that line of business is  percent of its total revenue</td>\n",

head of a conservative republican faction in the us congress who voted this month for a huge expansion of the national debt to pay for tax cuts called himself a “fiscal conservative” on sunday and urged budget restraint in  in keeping with a sharp pivot under way among republicans us representative mark meadows speaking on cbs’ “face the nation” drew a hard line on federal spending which lawmakers are bracing to do battle over in january when they return from the holidays on wednesday lawmakers will begin trying to pass a federal budget in a fight likely to be linked to other issues such as immigration policy even as the november congressional election campaigns approach in which republicans will seek to keep control of congress president donald trump and his republicans want a big budget increase in military spending while democrats also want proportional increases for nondefense “discretionary” spending on programs that support education scientific research infrastructure public health and environmental protection “the trump administration has already been willing to say ‘we’re going to increase nondefense discretionary spending  by about  percent’” meadows chairman of the small but influential house freedom caucus said on the program “now democrats are saying that’s not enough we need to give the government a pay raise of  to  percent for a fiscal conservative i don’t see where the rationale is  eventually you run out of other people’s money” he said meadows was among republicans who voted in late december for their party’s debtfinanced tax overhaul which is expected to balloon the federal budget deficit and add about  trillion over  years to the  trillion national debt “it’s interesting to hear mark talk about fiscal responsibility” democratic us representative joseph crowley said on cbs crowley said the republican tax bill would require the  united states to borrow  trillion to be paid off by future generations to finance tax cuts for corporations and the rich “this is one of the least  fiscally responsible bills we’ve ever seen passed in the history of the house of representatives i think we’re going to be paying for this for many many years to come” crowley said republicans insist the tax package the biggest us tax overhaul in more than  years  will boost the economy and job growth house speaker paul ryan who also supported the tax bill recently went further than meadows making clear in a radio interview that welfare or “entitlement reform” as the party often calls it would be a top republican priority in  in republican parlance “entitlement” programs mean food stamps housing assistance medicare and medicaid health insurance for the elderly poor and disabled as well as other programs created by washington to assist the needy democrats seized on ryan’s early december remarks saying they showed republicans would try to pay for their tax overhaul by seeking spending cuts for social programs but the goals of house republicans may have to take a back seat to the senate where the votes of some democrats will be needed to approve a budget and prevent a government shutdown democrats will use their leverage in the senate which republicans narrowly control to defend both discretionary nondefense programs and social spending while tackling the issue of the “dreamers” people brought illegally to the country as children trump in september put a march  expiration date on the deferred action for childhood arrivals or daca program which protects the young immigrants from deportation and provides them with work permits the president has said in recent twitter messages he wants funding for his proposed mexican border wall and other immigration law changes in exchange for agreeing to help the dreamers representative debbie dingell told cbs she did not favor linking that issue to other policy objectives such as wall funding “we need to do daca clean” she said  on wednesday trump aides will meet with congressional leaders to discuss those issues that will be followed by a weekend of strategy sessions for trump and republican leaders on jan  and  the white house said trump was also scheduled to meet on sunday with florida republican governor rick scott who wants more emergency aid the house has passed an  billion aid package after hurricanes in florida texas and puerto rico and wildfires in california the package far exceeded the  billion requested by the trump administration the senate has not yet voted on the aid    \n",

starting on monday as ordered by federal courts the pentagon said on friday after president donald trump’s administration decided not to appeal rulings that blocked his transgender ban two federal appeals courts one in washington and one in virginia last week rejected the administration’s request to put on hold orders by lower court judges requiring the military to begin accepting transgender recruits on jan  a justice department official said the administration will not challenge those rulings “the department of defense has announced that it will be releasing an independent study of these issues in the coming weeks so rather than litigate this interim appeal before that occurs the administration has decided to wait for dod’s study and will continue to defend the president’s lawful authority in district court in the meantime” the official said speaking on condition of anonymity in september the pentagon said it had created a panel of senior officials to study how to implement a directive by trump to prohibit transgender individuals from serving the defense department has until feb  to submit a plan to trump lawyers representing currentlyserving transgender service members and aspiring recruits said they had expected the administration to appeal the rulings to the conservativemajority supreme court but were hoping that would not happen pentagon spokeswoman heather babb said in a statement “as mandated by court order the department of defense is prepared to begin accessing transgender applicants for military service jan  all applicants must meet all accession standards” jennifer levi a lawyer with gay lesbian and transgender advocacy group glad called the decision not to appeal “great news” “i’m hoping it means the government has come to see that there is no way to justify a ban and that it’s not good for the military or our country” levi said both glad and the american civil liberties union represent plaintiffs in the lawsuits filed against the administration in a move that appealed to his hardline conservative supporters trump announced in july that he would prohibit transgender people from serving in the military reversing democratic president barack obama’s policy of accepting them trump said on twitter at the time that the military “cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail” four federal judges  in baltimore washington dc seattle and riverside california  have issued rulings blocking trump’s ban while legal challenges to the republican president’s policy proceed the judges said the ban would likely violate the right under the us constitution to equal protection under the law the pentagon on dec  issued guidelines to recruitment personnel in order to enlist transgender applicants by jan  the memo outlined medical requirements and specified how the applicants’ sex would be identified and even which undergarments they would wear the trump administration previously said in legal papers that the armed forces were not prepared to train thousands of personnel on the medical standards needed to process transgender applicants and might have to accept “some individuals who are not medically fit for service” the obama administration had set a deadline of july   to begin accepting transgender recruits but trump’s defense secretary james mattis postponed that date to jan   which the president’s ban then put off indefinitely trump has taken other steps aimed at rolling back transgender rights in october his administration said a federal law banning genderbased workplace discrimination does not protect transgender employees reversing another obamaera position in february trump rescinded guidance issued by the obama administration saying that public schools should allow transgender students to use the restroom that corresponds to their gender identity    \n",

links between russia and president trump’s  election campaign should continue without interference in  despite calls from some trump administration allies and republican lawmakers to shut it down a prominent republican senator said on sunday lindsey graham who serves on the senate armed forces and judiciary committees said department of justice special counsel robert mueller needs to carry on with his russia investigation without political interference “this investigation will go forward it will be an investigation conducted without political influence” graham said on cbs’s face the nation news program “and we all need to let mr mueller do his job i think he’s the right guy at the right time”  the question of how russia may have interfered in the election and how trump’s campaign may have had links with or coordinated any such effort has loomed over the white house since trump took office in january it shows no sign of receding as trump prepares for his second year in power despite intensified rhetoric from some trump allies in recent weeks accusing mueller’s team of bias against the republican president trump himself seemed to undercut his supporters in an interview last week with the new york times in which he said he expected mueller was “going to be fair”    russia’s role in the election and the question of possible links to the trump campaign are the focus of multiple inquiries in washington three committees of the senate and the house of representatives are investigating as well as mueller whose team in may took over an earlier probe launched by the us federal bureau of investigation fbi several members of the trump campaign and administration have been convicted or indicted in the investigation  trump and his allies deny any collusion with russia during the campaign and the kremlin has denied meddling in the election graham said he still wants an examination of the fbi’s use of a dossier on links between trump and russia that was compiled by a former british spy christopher steele which prompted trump allies and some republicans to question mueller’s inquiry   on saturday the new york times reported that it was not that dossier that triggered an early fbi probe but a tip from former trump campaign foreign policy adviser george papadopoulos to an australian diplomat that russia had damaging information about former trump rival hillary clinton  “i want somebody to look at the way the department of justice used this dossier it bothers me greatly the way they used it and i want somebody to look at it” graham said but he said the russia investigation must continue “as a matter of fact it would hurt us if we ignored it” he said    \n",

              fbi russia probe helped by australian diplomat tipoff nyt washington reuters  trump campaign adviser george papadopoulos told an australian diplomat in may  that russia had political dirt on democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton the new york times reported on saturday the conversation between papadopoulos and the diplomat alexander downer in london was a driving factor behind the fbi’s decision to open a counterintelligence investigation of moscow’s contacts with the trump campaign the times reported two months after the meeting australian officials passed the information that came from papadopoulos to their american counterparts when leaked democratic emails began appearing online according to the newspaper which cited four current and former us and foreign officials besides the information from the australians the probe by the federal bureau of investigation was also propelled by intelligence from other friendly governments including the british and dutch the times said papadopoulos a chicagobased international energy lawyer pleaded guilty on oct  to lying to fbi agents about contacts with people who claimed to have ties to top russian officials it was the first criminal charge alleging links between the trump campaign and russia the white house has played down the former aide’s campaign role saying it was “extremely limited” and that any actions he took would have been on his own the new york times however reported that papadopoulos helped set up a meeting between thencandidate donald trump and egyptian president abdel fattah alsisi and edited the outline of trump’s first major foreign policy speech in april  the federal investigation which is now being led by special counsel robert mueller has hung over trump’s white house since he took office almost a year ago some trump allies have recently accused mueller’s team of being biased against the republican president lawyers for papadopoulos did not immediately respond to requests by reuters for comment mueller’s office declined to comment trump’s white house attorney ty cobb declined to comment on the new york times report “out of respect for the special counsel and his process we are not commenting on matters such as this” he said in a statement mueller has charged four trump associates including papadopoulos in his investigation russia has denied interfering in the us election and trump has said there was no collusion between his campaign and moscow    \n",
       "4  trump wants postal service to charge much more for amazon shipments seattlewashington reuters  president donald trump called on the us postal service on friday to charge “much more” to ship packages for amazon amzno picking another fight with an online retail giant he has criticized in the past     “why is the united states post office which is losing many billions of dollars a year while charging amazon and others so little to deliver their packages making amazon richer and the post office dumber and poorer should be charging much more” trump wrote on twitter  the president’s tweet drew fresh attention to the fragile finances of the postal service at a time when tens of millions of parcels have just been shipped all over the country for the holiday season  the us postal service which runs at a big loss is an independent agency within the federal government and does not receive tax dollars for operating expenses according to its website  package delivery has become an increasingly important part of its business as the internet has led to a sharp decline in the amount of firstclass letters the president does not determine postal rates they are set by the postal regulatory commission an independent government agency with commissioners selected by the president from both political parties that panel raised prices on packages by almost  percent in november  amazon was founded by jeff bezos who remains the chief executive officer of the retail company and is the richest person in the world according to bloomberg news bezos also owns the washington post a newspaper trump has repeatedly railed against in his criticisms of the news media in tweets over the past year trump has said the “amazon washington post” fabricated stories he has said amazon does not pay sales tax which is not true and so hurts other retailers part of a pattern by the former businessman and reality television host of periodically turning his ire on big american companies since he took office in january daniel ives a research analyst at gbh insights said trump’s comment could be taken as a warning to the retail giant however he said he was not concerned for amazon “we do not see any price hikes in the future however that is a risk that amazon is clearly aware of and it is building out its distribution system aggressively” he said amazon has shown interest in the past in shifting into its own delivery service including testing drones for deliveries in  the company spent  billion on shipping  percent of its total operating expenses that year  amazon shares were down  percent to  by early afternoon overall us stock prices were down slightly on friday  satish jindel president of shipmatrix inc which analyzes shipping data disputed the idea that the postal service charges less than united parcel service inc upsn and fedex corp fdxn the other biggest players in the parcel delivery business in the united states many customers get lower rates from ups and fedex than they would get from the post office for comparable services he said the postal service delivers about  percent of amazon packages for about  to  million a day during the current peak yearend holiday shipping season jindel said the seattlebased company and the post office have an agreement in which mail carriers take amazon packages on the last leg of their journeys from post offices to customers’ doorsteps amazon’s no  carrier is ups at  percent and fedex is third with  percent or so according to jindel trump’s comment tapped into a debate over whether postal service pricing has kept pace with the rise of ecommerce which has flooded the mail with small packagesprivate companies like ups have long claimed the current system unfairly undercuts their business steve gaut a spokesman for ups noted that the company values its “productive relationship” with the postal service but that it has filed with the postal regulatory commission its concerns about the postal service’s methods for covering costs representatives for amazon the white house the us postal service and fedex declined comment or were not immediately available for comment on trump’s tweet according to its annual report the postal service lost  billion this year and its deficit has ballooned to  billion  while the postal service’s revenue for first class mail marketing mail and periodicals is flat or declining revenue from package delivery is up  percent since  to  billion in the fiscal year ended sept   but it also lost about  billion in revenue when a temporary surcharge expired in april  according to a government accountability office report in february the service is facing growing personnel expenses particularly  billion in unfunded pension and benefits liabilities the postal service has not announced any plans to cut costs by law the postal service has to set prices for package delivery to cover the costs attributable to that service but the postal service allocates only  percent of its total costs to its business of shipping packages even though that line of business is  percent of its total revenue    \n",

       "      <td>trump wants postal service to charge much more for amazon shipments seattlewashington reuters  president donald trump called on the us postal service on friday to charge “much more” to ship packages for amazon amzno picking another fight with an online retail giant he has criticized in the past     “why is the united states post office which is losing many billions of dollars a year while charging amazon and others so little to deliver their packages making amazon richer and the post office dumber and poorer should be charging much more” trump wrote on twitter  the president’s tweet drew fresh attention to the fragile finances of the postal service at a time when tens of millions of parcels have just been shipped all over the country for the holiday season  the us postal service which runs at a big loss is an independent agency within the federal government and does not receive tax dollars for operating expenses according to its website  package delivery has become an increasingly important part of its business as the internet has led to a sharp decline in the amount of firstclass letters the president does not determine postal rates they are set by the postal regulatory commission an independent government agency with commissioners selected by the president from both political parties that panel raised prices on packages by almost  percent in november  amazon was founded by jeff bezos who remains the chief executive officer of the retail company and is the richest person in the world according to bloomberg news bezos also owns the washington post a newspaper trump has repeatedly railed against in his criticisms of the news media in tweets over the past year trump has said the “amazon washington post” fabricated stories he has said amazon does not pay sales tax which is not true and so hurts other retailers part of a pattern by the former businessman and reality television host of periodically turning his ire on big american companies since he took office in january daniel ives a research analyst at gbh insights said trump’s comment could be taken as a warning to the retail giant however he said he was not concerned for amazon “we do not see any price hikes in the future however that is a risk that amazon is clearly aware of and it is building out its distribution system aggressively” he said amazon has shown interest in the past in shifting into its own delivery service including testing drones for deliveries in  the company spent  billion on shipping  percent of its total operating expenses that year  amazon shares were down  percent to  by early afternoon overall us stock prices were down slightly on friday  satish jindel president of shipmatrix inc which analyzes shipping data disputed the idea that the postal service charges less than united parcel service inc upsn and fedex corp fdxn the other biggest players in the parcel delivery business in the united states many customers get lower rates from ups and fedex than they would get from the post office for comparable services he said the postal service delivers about  percent of amazon packages for about  to  million a day during the current peak yearend holiday shipping season jindel said the seattlebased company and the post office have an agreement in which mail carriers take amazon packages on the last leg of their journeys from post offices to customers’ doorsteps amazon’s no  carrier is ups at  percent and fedex is third with  percent or so according to jindel trump’s comment tapped into a debate over whether postal service pricing has kept pace with the rise of ecommerce which has flooded the mail with small packagesprivate companies like ups have long claimed the current system unfairly undercuts their business steve gaut a spokesman for ups noted that the company values its “productive relationship” with the postal service but that it has filed with the postal regulatory commission its concerns about the postal service’s methods for covering costs representatives for amazon the white house the us postal service and fedex declined comment or were not immediately available for comment on trump’s tweet according to its annual report the postal service lost  billion this year and its deficit has ballooned to  billion  while the postal service’s revenue for first class mail marketing mail and periodicals is flat or declining revenue from package delivery is up  percent since  to  billion in the fiscal year ended sept   but it also lost about  billion in revenue when a temporary surcharge expired in april  according to a government accountability office report in february the service is facing growing personnel expenses particularly  billion in unfunded pension and benefits liabilities the postal service has not announced any plans to cut costs by law the postal service has to set prices for package delivery to cover the costs attributable to that service but the postal service allocates only  percent of its total costs to its business of shipping packages even though that line of business is  percent of its total revenue</td>\n",

urged budget restraint in  in keeping with a sharp pivot under way among republicans us representative mark meadows speaking on cbs’ “face the nation” drew a hard line on federal spending which lawmakers are bracing to do battle over in january when they return from the holidays on wednesday lawmakers will begin trying to pass a federal budget in a fight likely to be linked to other issues such as immigration policy even as the november congressional election campaigns approach in which republicans will seek to keep control of congress president donald trump and his republicans want a big budget increase in military spending while democrats also want proportional increases for nondefense “discretionary” spending on programs that support education scientific research infrastructure public health and environmental protection “the trump administration has already been willing to say ‘we’re going to increase nondefense discretionary spending  by about  percent’” meadows chairman of the small but influential house freedom caucus said on the program “now democrats are saying that’s not enough we need to give the government a pay raise of  to  percent for a fiscal conservative i

expected to balloon the federal budget deficit and add about  trillion over  years to the  trillion national debt “it’s interesting to hear mark talk about fiscal responsibility” democratic us representative joseph crowley said on cbs crowley said the republican tax bill would require the  united states to borrow  trillion to be paid off by future generations to finance tax cuts for corporations and the rich “this is one of the least  fiscally responsible bills we’ve ever seen passed in the history of the house of representatives i think we’re going to be paying for this for many many years to come” crowley said republicans insist the tax package the biggest us tax overhaul in more than  years  will boost the economy and job growth house speaker paul ryan who also supported the tax bill recently went further than meadows making clear in a radio interview that welfare or “entitlement reform” as the party often calls it would be a top republican priority in  in republican parlance “entitlement” programs mean food stamps housing assistance medicare and medicaid health insurance for the elderly poor and disabled as well as other programs created by washington to assist the needy democrats seized on ryan’s early december remarks saying they showed republicans would try to pay for their tax overhaul by seeking spending cuts for social programs but the goals of house republicans may have to take a back seat to the senate where the votes of some democrats will be needed to approve a budget and prevent a government shutdown democrats will use their leverage in the senate which republicans narrowly control to defend both discretionary nondefense programs and social spending while tackling the issue of the “dreamers” people brought illegally to the country as children trump in september put a march  expiration date on the deferred action for childhood arrivals or daca program which protects the young immigrants from deportation and provides them with work permits the president has said in recent twitter messages he wants funding for his proposed mexican border wall and other immigration law changes in exchange for agreeing to help the dreamers representative debbie dingell told cbs she did not favor linking that issue to other policy objectives such as wall funding “we need to do daca clean” she said  on wednesday trump aides will meet with congressional leaders to discuss those issues that will be followed by a weekend of strategy sessions for trump and republican leaders on jan  and  the white house said trump was also scheduled to meet on sunday with florida republican governor rick scott who wants more emergency aid the house has passed an  billion aid package after hurricanes in florida texas and puerto rico and wildfires in california the package far exceeded the  billion requested by the trump administration the senate has not yet voted on the aid    \n",

starting on monday as ordered by federal courts the pentagon said on friday after president donald trump’s administration decided not to appeal rulings that blocked his transgender ban two federal appeals courts one in washington and one in virginia last week rejected the administration’s request to put on hold orders by lower court judges requiring the military to begin accepting transgender recruits on jan  a justice department official said the administration will not challenge those rulings “the department of defense has announced that it will be releasing an independent study of these issues in the coming weeks so rather than litigate this interim appeal before that occurs the administration has decided to wait for dod’s study and will continue to defend the president’s lawful authority in district court in the meantime” the official said speaking on condition of anonymity in september the pentagon said it had created a panel of senior officials to study how to implement a directive by trump to prohibit transgender individuals from serving the defense department has until feb  to submit a plan to trump lawyers representing currentlyserving transgender service members and aspiring recruits said they had expected the administration to appeal the rulings to the conservativemajority supreme court but were hoping that would not happen pentagon spokeswoman heather babb said in a statement “as mandated by court order the department of defense is prepared to begin accessing transgender applicants for military service jan  all applicants must meet all accession standards” jennifer levi a lawyer with gay lesbian and transgender advocacy group glad called the decision not to appeal “great news” “i’m hoping it means the government has come to see that there is no way to justify a ban and that it’s not good for the military or our country” levi said both glad and the american civil liberties union represent plaintiffs in the lawsuits filed against the administration in a move that appealed to his hardline conservative supporters trump announced in july that he would prohibit transgender people from serving in the military reversing democratic president barack obama’s policy of accepting them trump said on twitter at the time that the military “cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail” four federal judges  in baltimore washington dc seattle and riverside california  have issued rulings blocking trump’s ban while legal challenges to the republican president’s policy proceed the judges said the ban would likely violate the right under the us constitution to equal protection under the law the pentagon on dec  issued guidelines to recruitment personnel in order to enlist transgender applicants by jan  the memo outlined medical requirements and specified how the applicants’ sex would be identified and even which undergarments they would wear the trump administration previously said in legal papers that the armed forces were not prepared to train thousands of personnel on the medical standards needed to process transgender applicants and might have to accept “some individuals who are not medically fit for service” the obama administration had set a deadline of july   to begin accepting transgender recruits but trump’s defense secretary james mattis postponed that date to jan   which the president’s ban then put off indefinitely trump has taken other steps aimed at rolling back transgender rights in october his administration said a federal law banning genderbased workplace discrimination does not protect transgender employees reversing another obamaera position in february trump rescinded guidance issued by the obama administration saying that public schools should allow transgender students to use the restroom that corresponds to their gender identity    \n",

links between russia and president trump’s  election campaign should continue without interference in  despite calls from some trump administration allies and republican lawmakers to shut it down a prominent republican senator said on sunday lindsey graham who serves on the senate armed forces and judiciary committees said department of justice special counsel robert mueller needs to carry on with his russia investigation without political interference “this investigation will go forward it will be an investigation conducted without political influence” graham said on cbs’s face the nation news program “and we all need to let mr mueller do his job i think he’s the right guy at the right time”  the question of how russia may have interfered in the election and how trump’s campaign may have had links with or coordinated any such effort has loomed over the white house since trump took office in january it shows no sign of receding as trump prepares for his second year in power despite intensified rhetoric from some trump allies in recent weeks accusing mueller’s team of bias against the republican president trump himself seemed to undercut his supporters in an interview last week with the new york times in which he said he expected mueller was “going to be fair”    russia’s role in the election and the question of possible links to the trump campaign are the focus of multiple inquiries in washington three committees of the senate and the house of representatives are investigating as well as mueller whose team in may took over an earlier probe launched by the us federal bureau of investigation fbi several members of the trump campaign and administration have been convicted or indicted in the investigation  trump and his allies deny any collusion with russia during the campaign and the kremlin has denied meddling in the election graham said he still wants an examination of the fbi’s use of a dossier on links between trump and russia that was compiled by a former british spy christopher steele which prompted trump allies and some republicans to question mueller’s inquiry   on saturday the new york times reported that it was not that dossier that triggered an early fbi probe but a tip from former trump campaign foreign policy adviser george papadopoulos to an australian diplomat that russia had damaging information about former trump rival hillary clinton  “i want somebody to look at the way the department of justice used this dossier it bothers me greatly the way they used it and i want somebody to look at it” graham said but he said the russia investigation must continue “as a matter of fact it would hurt us if we ignored it” he said    \n",

house since he took office almost a year ago some trump allies have recently accused mueller’s team of being biased against the republican president lawyers for papadopoulos did not immediately respond to requests by reuters for comment mueller’s office declined to comment trump’s white house attorney ty cobb declined to comment on the new york times report “out of respect for the special counsel and his process we are not commenting on matters such as this” he said in a statement mueller has charged four trump associates including papadopoulos in his investigation russia has denied interfering in the us election and trump has said there was no collusion between his campaign and moscow    \n",
       "4  trump wants postal service to charge much more for amazon shipments seattlewashington reuters  president donald trump called on the us postal service on friday to charge “much more” to ship packages for amazon amzno picking another fight with an online retail giant he has criticized in the past     “why is the united states post office which is losing many billions of dollars a year while charging amazon and others so little to deliver their packages making amazon richer and the post office dumber and poorer should be charging much more” trump wrote on twitter  the president’s tweet drew fresh attention to the fragile finances of the postal service at a time when tens of millions of parcels have just been shipped all over the country for the holiday season  the us postal service which runs at a big loss is an independent agency within the federal government and does not receive tax dollars for operating expenses according to its website  package delivery has become an increasingly important part of its business as the internet has led to a sharp decline in the amount of firstclass letters the president does not determine postal rates they are set by the postal regulatory commission an independent government agency with commissioners selected by the president from both political parties that panel raised prices on packages by almost  percent in november  amazon was founded by jeff bezos who remains the chief executive officer of the retail company and is the richest person in the world according to bloomberg news bezos also owns the washington post a newspaper trump has repeatedly railed against in his criticisms of the news media in tweets over the past year trump has said the “amazon washington post” fabricated stories he has said amazon does not pay sales tax which is not true and so hurts other retailers part of a pattern by the former businessman and reality television host of periodically turning his ire on big american companies since he took office in january daniel ives a research analyst at gbh insights said trump’s comment could be taken as a warning to the retail giant however he said he was not concerned for amazon “we do not see any price hikes in the future however that is a risk that amazon is clearly aware of and it is building out its distribution system aggressively” he said amazon has shown interest in the past in shifting into its own delivery service including testing drones for deliveries in  the company spent  billion on shipping  percent of its total operating expenses that year  amazon shares were down  percent to  by early afternoon overall us stock prices were down slightly on friday  satish jindel president of shipmatrix inc which analyzes shipping data disputed the idea that the postal service charges less than united parcel service inc upsn and fedex corp fdxn the other biggest players in the parcel delivery business in the united states many customers get lower rates from ups and fedex than they would get from the post office for comparable services he said the postal service delivers about  percent of amazon packages for about  to  million a day during the current peak yearend holiday shipping season jindel said the seattlebased company and the post office have an agreement in which mail carriers take amazon packages on the last leg of their journeys from post offices to customers’ doorsteps amazon’s no  carrier is ups at  percent and fedex is third with  percent or so according to jindel trump’s comment tapped into a debate over whether postal service pricing has kept pace with the rise of ecommerce which has flooded the mail with small packagesprivate companies like ups have long claimed the current system unfairly undercuts their business steve gaut a spokesman for ups noted that the company values its “productive relationship” with the postal service but that it has filed with the postal regulatory commission its concerns about the postal service’s methods for covering costs representatives for amazon the white house the us postal service and fedex declined comment or were not immediately available for comment on trump’s tweet according to its annual report the postal service lost  billion this year and its deficit has ballooned to  billion  while the postal service’s revenue for first class mail marketing mail and periodicals is flat or declining revenue from package delivery is up  percent since  to  billion in the fiscal year ended sept   but it also lost about  billion in revenue when a temporary surcharge expired in april  according to a government accountability office report in february the service is facing growing personnel expenses particularly  billion in unfunded pension and benefits liabilities the postal service has not announced any plans to cut costs by law the postal service has to set prices for package delivery to cover the costs attributable to that service but the postal service allocates only  percent of its total costs to its business of shipping packages even though that line of business is  percent of its total revenue    \n",

to ship packages for amazon amzno picking another fight with an online retail giant he has criticized in the past     “why is the united states post office which is losing many billions of dollars a year while charging amazon and others so little to deliver their packages making amazon richer and the post office dumber and poorer should be charging much more” trump wrote on twitter  the president’s tweet drew fresh attention to the fragile finances of the postal service at a time when tens of millions of parcels have just been shipped all over the country for the holiday season  the us postal service which runs at a big loss is an independent agency within the federal government and does not receive tax dollars for operating expenses according to its website  package delivery has become an increasingly important part of its business as the internet has led to a sharp decline in the amount of firstclass letters the president does not determine postal rates they are set by the postal regulatory commission an independent government agency with commissioners selected by the president from both political parties that panel raised prices on packages by almost  percent in november  amazon was founded by jeff bezos who remains the chief executive officer of the retail company and is the richest person in the world according to bloomberg news bezos also owns the washington post a newspaper trump has repeatedly railed against in his criticisms of the news media in tweets over the past year trump has said the “amazon washington post” fabricated stories he has said amazon does not pay sales tax which is not true and so hurts other retailers part of a pattern by the former businessman and reality television host of periodically turning his ire on big american companies since he took office in january daniel ives a research analyst at gbh insights said trump’s comment could be taken as a warning to the retail giant however he said he was not concerned for amazon “we do not see any price hikes in the future however that is a risk that amazon is clearly aware of and it is building out its distribution system aggressively” he said amazon has shown interest in the past in shifting into its own delivery service including testing drones for deliveries in  the company spent  billion on shipping  percent of its total operating expenses that year  amazon shares were down  percent to  by early afternoon overall us stock prices were down slightly on friday  satish jindel president of shipmatrix inc which analyzes shipping data disputed the idea that the postal service charges less than united parcel service inc upsn and fedex corp fdxn the other biggest players in the parcel delivery business in the united states many customers get lower rates from ups and fedex than they would get from the post office for comparable services he said the postal service delivers about  percent of amazon packages for about  to  million a day during the current peak yearend holiday shipping season jindel said the seattlebased company and the post office have an agreement in which mail carriers take amazon packages on the last leg of their journeys from post offices to customers’ doorsteps amazon’s no  carrier is ups at  percent and fedex is third with  percent or so according to jindel trump’s comment tapped into a debate over whether postal service pricing has kept pace with the rise of ecommerce which has flooded the mail with small packagesprivate companies like ups have long claimed the current system unfairly undercuts their business steve gaut a spokesman for ups noted that the company values its “productive relationship” with the postal service but that it has filed with the postal regulatory commission its concerns about the postal service’s methods for covering costs representatives for amazon the white house the us postal service and fedex declined comment or were not immediately available for comment on trump’s tweet according to its annual report the postal service lost  billion this year and its deficit has ballooned to  billion  while the postal service’s revenue for first class mail marketing mail and periodicals is flat or declining revenue from package delivery is up  percent since  to  billion in the fiscal year ended sept   but it also lost about  billion in revenue when a temporary surcharge expired in april  according to a government accountability office report in february the service is facing growing personnel expenses particularly  billion in unfunded pension and benefits liabilities the postal service has not announced any plans to cut costs by law the postal service has to set prices for package delivery to cover the costs attributable to that service but the postal service allocates only  percent of its total costs to its business of shipping packages even though that line of business is  percent of its total revenue</td>\n",

head of a conservative republican faction in the us congress who voted this month for a huge expansion of the national debt to pay for tax cuts called himself a “fiscal conservative” on sunday and urged budget restraint in  in keeping with a sharp pivot under way among republicans us representative mark meadows speaking on cbs’ “face the nation” drew a hard line on federal spending which lawmakers are bracing to do battle over in january when they return from the holidays on wednesday lawmakers will begin trying to pass a federal budget in a fight likely to be linked to other issues such as immigration policy even as the november congressional election campaigns approach in which republicans will seek to keep control of congress president donald trump and his republicans want a big budget increase in military spending while democrats also want proportional increases for nondefense “discretionary” spending on programs that support education scientific research infrastructure public health and environmental protection “the trump administration has already been willing to say ‘we’re going to increase nondefense discretionary spending  by about  percent’” meadows chairman of the small but influential house freedom caucus said on the program “now democrats are saying that’s not enough we need to give the government a pay raise of  to  percent for a fiscal conservative i don’t see where the rationale is  eventually you run out of other people’s money” he said meadows was among republicans who voted in late december for their party’s debtfinanced tax overhaul which is expected to balloon the federal budget deficit and add about  trillion over  years to the  trillion national debt “it’s interesting to hear mark talk about fiscal responsibility” democratic us representative joseph crowley said on cbs crowley said the republican tax bill would require the  united states to borrow  trillion to be paid off by future generations to finance tax cuts for corporations and the rich “this is one of the least  fiscally responsible bills we’ve ever seen passed in the history of the house of representatives i think we’re going to be paying for this for many many years to come” crowley said republicans insist the tax package the biggest us tax overhaul in more than  years  will boost the economy and job growth house speaker paul ryan who also supported the tax bill recently went further than meadows making clear in a radio interview that welfare or “entitlement reform” as the party often calls it would be a top republican priority in  in republican parlance “entitlement” programs mean food stamps housing assistance medicare and medicaid health insurance for the elderly poor and disabled as well as other programs created by washington to assist the needy democrats seized on ryan’s early december remarks saying they showed republicans would try to pay for their tax overhaul by seeking spending cuts for social programs but the goals of house republicans may have to take a back seat to the senate where the votes of some democrats will be needed to approve a budget and prevent a government shutdown democrats will use their leverage in the senate which republicans narrowly control to defend both discretionary nondefense programs and social spending while tackling the issue of the “dreamers” people brought illegally to the country as children trump in september put a march  expiration date on the deferred action for childhood arrivals or daca program which protects the young immigrants from deportation and provides them with work permits the president has said in recent twitter messages he wants funding for his proposed mexican border wall and other immigration law changes in exchange for agreeing to help the dreamers representative debbie dingell told cbs she did not favor linking that issue to other policy objectives such as wall funding “we need to do daca clean” she said  on wednesday trump aides will meet with congressional leaders to discuss those issues that will be followed by a weekend of strategy sessions for trump and republican leaders on jan  and  the white house said trump was also scheduled to meet on sunday with florida republican governor rick scott who wants more emergency aid the house has passed an  billion aid package after hurricanes in florida texas and puerto rico and wildfires in california the package far exceeded the  billion requested by the trump administration the senate has not yet voted on the aid    \n",

starting on monday as ordered by federal courts the pentagon said on friday after president donald trump’s administration decided not to appeal rulings that blocked his transgender ban two federal appeals courts one in washington and one in virginia last week rejected the administration’s request to put on hold orders by lower court judges requiring the military to begin accepting transgender recruits on jan  a justice department official said the administration will not challenge those rulings “the department of defense has announced that it will be releasing an independent study of these issues in the coming weeks so rather than litigate this interim appeal before that occurs the administration has decided to wait for dod’s study and will continue to defend the president’s lawful authority in district court in the meantime” the official said speaking on condition of anonymity in september the pentagon said it had created a panel of senior officials to study how to implement a directive by trump to prohibit transgender individuals from serving the defense department has until feb  to submit a plan to trump lawyers representing currentlyserving transgender service members and aspiring recruits said they had expected the administration to appeal the rulings to the conservativemajority supreme court but were hoping that would not happen pentagon spokeswoman heather babb said in a statement “as mandated by court order the department of defense is prepared to begin accessing transgender applicants for military service jan  all applicants must meet all accession standards” jennifer levi a lawyer with gay lesbian and transgender advocacy group glad called the decision not to appeal “great news” “i’m hoping it means the government has come to see that there is no way to justify a ban and that it’s not good for the military or our country” levi said both glad and the american civil liberties union represent plaintiffs in the lawsuits filed against the administration in a move that appealed to his hardline conservative supporters trump announced in july that he would prohibit transgender people from serving in the military reversing democratic president barack obama’s policy of accepting them trump said on twitter at the time that the military “cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail” four federal judges  in baltimore washington dc seattle and riverside california  have issued rulings blocking trump’s ban while legal challenges to the republican president’s policy proceed the judges said the ban would likely violate the right under the us constitution to equal protection under the law the pentagon on dec  issued guidelines to recruitment personnel in order to enlist transgender applicants by jan  the memo outlined medical requirements and specified how the applicants’ sex would be identified and even which undergarments they would wear the trump administration previously said in legal papers that the armed forces were not prepared to train thousands of personnel on the medical standards needed to process transgender applicants and might have to accept “some individuals who are not medically fit for service” the obama administration had set a deadline of july   to begin accepting transgender recruits but trump’s defense secretary james mattis postponed that date to jan   which the president’s ban then put off indefinitely trump has taken other steps aimed at rolling back transgender rights in october his administration said a federal law banning genderbased workplace discrimination does not protect transgender employees reversing another obamaera position in february trump rescinded guidance issued by the obama administration saying that public schools should allow transgender students to use the restroom that corresponds to their gender identity    \n",

links between russia and president trump’s  election campaign should continue without interference in  despite calls from some trump administration allies and republican lawmakers to shut it down a prominent republican senator said on sunday lindsey graham who serves on the senate armed forces and judiciary committees said department of justice special counsel robert mueller needs to carry on with his russia investigation without political interference “this investigation will go forward it will be an investigation conducted without political influence” graham said on cbs’s face the nation news program “and we all need to let mr mueller do his job i think he’s the right guy at the right time”  the question of how russia may have interfered in the election and how trump’s campaign may have had links with or coordinated any such effort has loomed over the white house since trump took office in january it shows no sign of receding as trump prepares for his second year in power despite intensified rhetoric from some trump allies in recent weeks accusing mueller’s team of bias against the republican president trump himself seemed to undercut his supporters in an interview last week with the new york times in which he said he expected mueller was “going to be fair”    russia’s role in the election and the question of possible links to the trump campaign are the focus of multiple inquiries in washington three committees of the senate and the house of representatives are investigating as well as mueller whose team in may took over an earlier probe launched by the us federal bureau of investigation fbi several members of the trump campaign and administration have been convicted or indicted in the investigation  trump and his allies deny any collusion with russia during the campaign and the kremlin has denied meddling in the election graham said he still wants an examination of the fbi’s use of a dossier on links between trump and russia that was compiled by a former british spy christopher steele which prompted trump allies and some republicans to question mueller’s inquiry   on saturday the new york times reported that it was not that dossier that triggered an early fbi probe but a tip from former trump campaign foreign policy adviser george papadopoulos to an australian diplomat that russia had damaging information about former trump rival hillary clinton  “i want somebody to look at the way the department of justice used this dossier it bothers me greatly the way they used it and i want somebody to look at it” graham said but he said the russia investigation must continue “as a matter of fact it would hurt us if we ignored it” he said    \n",

dirt on democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton the new york times reported on saturday the conversation between papadopoulos and the diplomat alexander downer in london was a driving factor behind the fbi’s decision to open a counterintelligence investigation of moscow’s contacts with the trump campaign the times reported two months after the meeting australian officials passed the information that came from papadopoulos to their american counterparts when leaked democratic emails began appearing online according to the newspaper which cited four current and former us and foreign officials besides the information from the australians the probe by the federal bureau of investigation was also propelled by intelligence from other friendly governments including the british and dutch the times said papadopoulos a chicagobased international energy lawyer pleaded guilty on oct  to lying to fbi agents about contacts with people who claimed to have ties to top russian officials it was the first criminal charge alleging links between the trump campaign and russia the white house has played down the former aide’s campaign role saying it was “extremely limited” and that any actions he took would have been on his own the new york times however reported that papadopoulos helped set up a meeting between thencandidate donald trump and egyptian president abdel fattah alsisi and edited the outline of trump’s first major foreign policy speech in april  the federal investigation which is now being led by special counsel robert mueller has hung over trump’s white house since he took office almost a year ago some trump allies have recently accused mueller’s team of being biased against the republican president lawyers for papadopoulos did not immediately respond to requests by reuters for comment mueller’s office declined to comment trump’s white house attorney ty cobb declined to comment on the new york times report “out of respect for the special counsel and his process we are not commenting on matters such as this” he said in a statement mueller has charged four trump associates including papadopoulos in his investigation russia has denied interfering in the us election and trump has said there was no collusion between his campaign and moscow    \n",
       "4  trump wants postal service to charge much more for amazon shipments seattlewashington reuters  president donald trump called on the us postal service on friday to charge “much more” to ship packages for amazon amzno picking another fight with an online retail giant he has criticized in the past     “why is the united states post office which is losing many billions of dollars a year while charging amazon and others so little to deliver their packages making amazon richer and the post office dumber and poorer should be charging much more” trump wrote on twitter  the president’s tweet drew fresh attention to the fragile finances of the postal service at a time when tens of millions of parcels have just been shipped all over the country for the holiday season  the us postal service which runs at a big loss is an independent agency within the federal government and does not receive tax dollars for operating expenses according to its website  package delivery has become an increasingly important part of its business as the internet has led to a sharp decline in the amount of firstclass letters the president does not determine postal rates they are set by the postal regulatory commission an independent government agency with commissioners selected by the president from both political parties that panel raised prices on packages by almost  percent in november  amazon was founded by jeff bezos who remains the chief executive officer of the retail company and is the richest person in the world according to bloomberg news bezos also owns the washington post a newspaper trump has repeatedly railed against in his criticisms of the news media in tweets over the past year trump has said the “amazon washington post” fabricated stories he has said amazon does not pay sales tax which is not true and so hurts other retailers part of a pattern by the former businessman and reality television host of periodically turning his ire on big american companies since he took office in january daniel ives a research analyst at gbh insights said trump’s comment could be taken as a warning to the retail giant however he said he was not concerned for amazon “we do not see any price hikes in the future however that is a risk that amazon is clearly aware of and it is building out its distribution system aggressively” he said amazon has shown interest in the past in shifting into its own delivery service including testing drones for deliveries in  the company spent  billion on shipping  percent of its total operating expenses that year  amazon shares were down  percent to  by early afternoon overall us stock prices were down slightly on friday  satish jindel president of shipmatrix inc which analyzes shipping data disputed the idea that the postal service charges less than united parcel service inc upsn and fedex corp fdxn the other biggest players in the parcel delivery business in the united states many customers get lower rates from ups and fedex than they would get from the post office for comparable services he said the postal service delivers about  percent of amazon packages for about  to  million a day during the current peak yearend holiday shipping season jindel said the seattlebased company and the post office have an agreement in which mail carriers take amazon packages on the last leg of their journeys from post offices to customers’ doorsteps amazon’s no  carrier is ups at  percent and fedex is third with  percent or so according to jindel trump’s comment tapped into a debate over whether postal service pricing has kept pace with the rise of ecommerce which has flooded the mail with small packagesprivate companies like ups have long claimed the current system unfairly undercuts their business steve gaut a spokesman for ups noted that the company values its “productive relationship” with the postal service but that it has filed with the postal regulatory commission its concerns about the postal service’s methods for covering costs representatives for amazon the white house the us postal service and fedex declined comment or were not immediately available for comment on trump’s tweet according to its annual report the postal service lost  billion this year and its deficit has ballooned to  billion  while the postal service’s revenue for first class mail marketing mail and periodicals is flat or declining revenue from package delivery is up  percent since  to  billion in the fiscal year ended sept   but it also lost about  billion in revenue when a temporary surcharge expired in april  according to a government accountability office report in february the service is facing growing personnel expenses particularly  billion in unfunded pension and benefits liabilities the postal service has not announced any plans to cut costs by law the postal service has to set prices for package delivery to cover the costs attributable to that service but the postal service allocates only  percent of its total costs to its business of shipping packages even though that line of business is  percent of its total revenue    \n",
